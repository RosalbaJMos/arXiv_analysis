0,242,242,Biased Hypothesis Formation From Projection Pursuit,"The effect of bias on hypothesis formation is characterized for an automated
data-driven projection pursuit neural network to extract and select features
for binary classification of data streams. This intelligent exploratory process
partitions a complete vector state space into disjoint subspaces to create
working hypotheses quantified by similarities and differences observed between
two groups of labeled data streams. Data streams are typically time sequenced,
and may exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns. For example, given atomic
trajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine's task is to
quantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein
mutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing
synthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and
nonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the
machine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The
refinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust
multivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective.
Including diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances
interpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and
differences.","['cs.LG', 'physics.bio-ph', 'q-bio.BM', 'stat.ML']",2022-01-03,2201.00889,,"['John Patterson', 'Chris Avery', 'Tyler Grear', 'Donald J. Jacobs']",2022,1
1,316,316,Nanowars can cause epidemic resurgence and fail to promote cooperation,"In a non-sustainable, ""over-populated"" world, what might the use of
nanotechnology-based targeted, autonomous weapons mean for the future of
humanity? In order to gain some insights, we make a simplified game-theoretical
thought experiment. We consider a population where agents play the public goods
game, and where in parallel an epidemic unfolds. Agents that are infected
defectors are killed with a certain probability and replaced by susceptible
cooperators. We show that such ""nanowars"", even if aiming to promote good
behavior and planetary health, fail not only to promote cooperation, but they
also significantly increase the probability of repetitive epidemic waves. In
fact, newborn cooperators turn out to be easy targets for defectors in their
neighborhood. Therefore, counterintuitively, the discussed intervention may
even have the opposite effect as desired, promoting defection. We also find a
critical threshold for the death rate of infected defectors, beyond which
resurgent epidemic waves become a certainty. In conclusion, we urgently call
for international regulation of nanotechnology and autonomous weapons.","['physics.soc-ph', 'cs.AI', 'q-bio.PE']",2022-01-12,2201.04747,,"['Dirk Helbing', 'Matjaž Perc']",2022,1
2,328,328,How Smart Should a Forager Be?,"We introduce an idealized model of an intelligent forager in which higher
intelligence corresponds to a larger spatial range over which the forager can
detect food. Such a forager diffuses randomly whenever the nearest food is more
distant than the forager's detection range, $R$, and moves ballistically
towards the nearest food inside its detection range. Concomitantly, the
forager's metabolic energy cost per step is an increasing function of its
intelligence. A dumb forager wanders randomly and may miss nearby food, thus
making it susceptible to starvation. Conversely, a too-smart forager incurs a
large metabolic cost per step during its search for food and is again
susceptible to starvation. We show that the forager's lifetime is maximized at
an optimal, intermediate level of intelligence.","['physics.bio-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'q-bio.QM']",2022-01-13,2201.05254,,"['U. Bhat', 'S. Redner']",2022,1

adopt generic architectures like fully connected MLPs. While general, these
tabula rasa architectures rely on large amounts of experience to learn, are not
easily transferable to new bodies, and have internal dynamics that are
difficult to interpret. In nature, animals are born with highly structured
connectivity in their nervous systems shaped by evolution; this innate
circuitry acts synergistically with learning mechanisms to provide inductive
biases that enable most animals to function well soon after birth and improve
abilities efficiently. Convolutional networks inspired by visual circuitry have
encoded useful biases for vision. However, it is unknown the extent to which
ANN architectures inspired by neural circuitry can yield useful biases for
other domains. In this work, we ask what advantages biologically inspired
network architecture can provide in the context of motor control. Specifically,
we translate C. elegans circuits for locomotion into an ANN model controlling a
simulated Swimmer agent. On a locomotion task, our architecture achieves good
initial performance and asymptotic performance comparable with MLPs, while
dramatically improving data efficiency and requiring orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Our architecture is more interpretable and transfers to new body
designs. An ablation analysis shows that principled excitation/inhibition is
crucial for learning, while weight initialization contributes to good initial
performance. Our work demonstrates several advantages of ANN architectures
inspired by systems neuroscience and suggests a path towards modeling more
complex behavior.","['cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'cs.RO', 'q-bio.NC']",2022-01-13,2201.05242,,"['Nikhil X. Bhattasali', 'Anthony M. Zador', 'Tatiana A. Engel']",2022,1

  applications","We study a stochastic individual-based model of interacting plant and
pollinator species through a bipartite graph: each species is a node of the
graph, an edge representing interactions between a pair of species. The
dynamics of the system depends on the between- and within-species interactions:
pollination by insects increases plant reproduction rate but has a cost which
can increase plant death rate, depending on pollinators density. Pollinators
reproduction is increased by the resources harvested on plants. Each species is
characterized by a trait corresponding to its degree of generalism. This trait
determines the structure of the interactions graph and the quantity of
resources exchanged between species. Our model includes in particular nested or
modular networks. Deterministic approximations of the stochastic measure-valued
process by systems of ordinary differential equations or integro-differential
equations are established and studied, when the population is large or when the
graph is dense and can be replaced with a graphon. The long-time behaviors of
these limits are studied and central limit theorems are established to quantify
the difference between the discrete stochastic individual-based model and the
deterministic approximations. Finally, studying the continuous limits of the

studies. With recent technological advances, metagenomics has become a problem
of interest. This problem entails the analysis and reconstruction of multiple

breaking up long DNA sequences into shorter segments called reads. Given this
collection of reads, one would like to reconstruct the original collection of
DNA sequences. For experimental design in metagenomics, it is important to
understand how the minimal read length necessary for reliable reconstruction
depends on the number and characteristics of the genomes involved. Utilizing
simple probabilistic models for each DNA sequence, we analyze the
identifiability of collections of M genomes of length N in an asymptotic regime
in which N tends to infinity and M may grow with N. Our first main result
provides a threshold in terms of M and N so that if the read length exceeds the
threshold, then a simple greedy algorithm successfully reconstructs the full

stem-loop structures forming along the complementary strands, which compete
against the formation of the native hairpin. This landscape correlates with the
hysteresis observed along the FDCs. RNA sequence analysis shows that base

infected premises, and feed deliveries has not been fully considered in the
dissemination dynamics of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). This has
limited efforts for disease control and elimination restricting the development
of risk-based resource allocation to the most relevant modes of PEDV
dissemination. Here, we modeled nine modes of between-farm transmission
pathways including farm-to-farm proximity (local transmission), contact network
of pig farm movements between sites, four different contact networks of
transportation vehicles (vehicles that transport pigs from farm-to-farm, pigs
to markets, feed distribution and crew), the volume of animal by-products
within feed diets (e.g. animal fat and meat and bone meal) to reproduce PEDV
transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated in space and time with weekly
PEDV outbreaks. We investigated the model performance to identify outbreak
locations and the contribution of each route in the dissemination of PEDV. The
model estimated that 42.7% of the infections in sow farms were related to
vehicles transporting feed, 34.5% of infected nurseries were associated with
vehicles transporting pigs to farms, and for both farm types, pig movements or
local transmission were the next most relevant routes. On the other hand,
finishers were most often (31.4%) infected via local transmission, followed by
the vehicles transporting feed and pigs to farm networks. Feed ingredients did
not significantly improve model calibration metrics. The proposed modeling

parameter uncertainty, we employ a Bayesian approach and apply an adaptive
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to determine posterior probability
distributions for the model parameters. The obtained posterior distributions

quantify the uncertainty in their values for each tendon sample that was

in microbial communities, they can regulate the composition/function of
microbiome by infecting their bacterial hosts and mediating gene transfer.
Recently, metagenomic sequencing, which can sequence all genetic materials from
various microbiome, has become a popular means for new phage discovery.
However, accurate and comprehensive detection of phages from the metagenomic
data remains difficult. High diversity/abundance, and limited reference genomes
pose major challenges for recruiting phage fragments from metagenomic data.
Existing alignment-based or learning-based models have either low recall or
precision on metagenomic data.
  Results: In this work, we adopt the state-of-the-art language model,
Transformer, to conduct contextual embedding for phage contigs. By constructing
a protein-cluster vocabulary, we can feed both the protein composition and the
proteins' positions from each contig into the Transformer. The Transformer can
learn the protein organization and associations using the self-attention
mechanism and predicts the label for test contigs. We rigorously tested our

14,315,315,Peak infection rate in epidemic spreading for multi-community networks,"One of the most effective strategies to mitigate the global spreading of a
pandemic (e.g., COVID-19) is to shut down international airports. From a
network theory perspective, this is since international airports and flights,
essentially playing the roles of bridge nodes and bridge links between
countries as individual communities, dominate the epidemic spreading
characteristics in the whole multi-community system. Among all epidemic
characteristics, the peak infection rate, $I_{\max}$, is a decisive factor in
evaluating an epidemic strategy given limited capacity of medical resources,
but is seldom considered in multi-community models. In this paper, we study a
general two-community system interconnected by a fraction $r$ of bridge nodes
and its dynamic properties, especially $I_{\max}$, under the evolution of the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Comparing the characteristic time
scales of different parts of the system allows us to analytically derive the
asymptotic behavior of $I_{\max}$ with $r$, as $r\rightarrow 0$, which follows
different power-law relations in each regime of the phase diagram. We also
detect crossovers where $I_{\max}$ follows power-law relations from different
regimes on both sides, when $r$ is not small enough. Our results enable a
better prediction of the effectiveness of strategies acting on bridge nodes,

26,302,302,Outlearning Extortioners by Fair-minded Unbending Strategies,"Recent theory shows that extortioners taking advantage of the
zero-determinant (ZD) strategy can unilaterally claim an unfair share of the
payoffs in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. It is thus suggested that against a
fixed extortioner, any adapting co-player should be subdued with full
cooperation as their best response. In contrast, recent experiments demonstrate
that human players often choose not to accede to extortion out of concern for
fairness, actually causing extortioners to suffer more loss than themselves. In
light of this, here we reveal fair-minded strategies that are unbending to
extortion such that any payoff-maximizing extortioner ultimately will concede
in their own interest by offering a fair split in head-to-head matches. We find
and characterize multiple general classes of such unbending strategies,
including generous zero-determinant strategies and Win-Stay, Lose-Shift as
particular examples. When against fixed unbending players, extortioners are
forced with consequentially increasing losses whenever intending to demand more
unfair share. Our analysis also pivots to the importance of payoff structure in
determining the superiority of zero-determinant strategies and in particular
their extortion ability. We show that an extortionate ZD player can be even
outperformed by, for example, Win-Stay Lose-Shift, if the total payoff of
unilateral cooperation is smaller than that of mutual defection. Unbending
strategies can be used to outlearn evolutionary extortioners and catalyze the
evolution of Tit-for-Tat-like strategies out of ZD players. Our work has
implications for promoting fairness and resisting extortion so as to uphold a
just and cooperative society.","['physics.soc-ph', 'q-bio.PE']",2022-01-11,2201.04198,,"['Xingru Chen', 'Feng Fu']",2022,1

  impedes the evolution of the population","Range expansion is a universal process in biological systems, and therefore
plays a part in biological evolution. Using a quantitative individual-based
method based on the stochastic process, we identify that enhancing the inherent
self-proliferation advantage of cooperators relative to defectors is a more
effective channel to promote the evolution of cooperation in range expansion
than weakening the benefit acquisition of defectors from cooperators. With this
self-proliferation advantage, cooperators can rapidly colonize virgin space and
establish spatial segregation more readily, which acts like a protective shield
to further promote the evolution of cooperation in return. We also show that
lower cell density and migration rate have a positive effect on the competition
of cooperators with defectors. Biological evolution is based on competition
between individuals and should therefore favor selfish behaviors. However, we
observe a counterintuitive phenomenon that the evolution of a population is
impeded by the fitness-enhancing chemotactic movement of individuals. This
highlights a conflict between the interests of the individual and the
population. The short-sighted selfish behavior of individuals may not be that
favored in the competition between populations. Such information provides
important implications for the handling of cooperation.","['q-bio.PE', 'physics.bio-ph']",2022-01-14,2201.05353,,"['Xiaoliang Wang', 'Andrew Harrison']",2022,1

  defense and nonreproductive stages","During recent years, the study of long transients has been expanded in
ecological theory to account for shifts in long-term behavior of ecological
systems. These long transients may lead to regime shifts between alternative
states that resemble the dynamics of alternative stable states for a prolonged
period of time. One dynamic that potentially leads to long transients is the
group defense of a resource in a consumer-resource interaction. Furthermore,
time lags in the population caused by discrete reproductive pulses have the
potential to produce long transients, either independently or in conjunction to
the transients caused by the group defense. In this work, we analyze the
potential for long transients in a model for a consumer-resource system in
which the resource exhibits group defense and reproduces in discrete
reproductive pulses. We develop this discrete-time model by discretizing a
pulse differential equation. This system exhibits crawl-by transients near the
extinction and carrying capacity states of resource. In addition, we identify a
transcritical bifurcation in our system, under which a ghost limit cycle
appears. These transients resemble stable states for a prolonged transient time

mechanically, from the tympanum to the cochlea via ossicles. However this
theory does not explain the hearing extreme quality regarding high frequencies

complementary to the overt path. We demonstrate experimentally that the
tympanum produces piezoelectric potentials isochronous to acoustic vibrations
thanks to its collagen fibers and that their amplitude increases along with the
frequency and level of the vibrations. This finding supports the existence of
an electrical pathway, specialized in transmitting high-frequency sounds that
works in unison with the mechanical pathway. A bio-organic triode, similar to a
field effect transistor, is the key mechanism of our hypothesized pathway. We
present evidence that any deficiency along this pathway produces hearing

transmission dynamics with mutation and imperfect vaccination. It is also
assumed that the recuperated individuals from the native strain can be infected
with mutant strain through the direct contact with individual or contaminated
surfaces or aerosols. We compute the basic reproduction number for each strain
independently and take the maximum for $R_0$. We prove the nonexistence of
backward bifurcation using the center manifold theory, and global stability of
disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number $R_0<1. An
intermediate mutation rate $\nu_1$ leads to oscillations. When $\nu_1$
increases over a threshold, the system regains its stability and exhibits an
interesting dynamics called endemic bubble. An analytical expression for
vaccine-induced herd immunity is derived. The model is parameterized using the
Indian data of the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19
from March 1 to September 27 in 2021, using MCMC method. The cumulative cases
and deaths can be reduced by increasing the vaccine efficacies to both native

3.27\% and 5.2\%, respectively; and by considering the vaccine efficacy to
mutant strain as 90\%, the cumulative cases and deaths would be reduced by

estimation methods depend on a large number of high-quality measurements. This
would require long scan times and can be particularly difficult to achieve with
certain patient populations such as neonates. Here, we propose a method that
can accurately estimate the diffusion tensor from only six diffusion-weighted
measurements. Our method achieves this by learning to exploit the relationships
between the diffusion signals and tensors in neighboring voxels. Our model is
based on transformer networks, which represent the state of the art in modeling
the relationship between signals in a sequence. In particular, our model
consists of two such networks. The first network estimates the diffusion tensor
based on the diffusion signals in a neighborhood of voxels. The second network
provides more accurate tensor estimations by learning the relationships between
the diffusion signals as well as the tensors estimated by the first network in
neighboring voxels. Our experiments with three datasets show that our proposed
method achieves highly accurate estimations of the diffusion tensor and is
significantly superior to three competing methods. Estimations produced by our
method with six measurements are comparable with those of standard estimation
methods with 30-88 measurements. Hence, our method promises shorter scan times

non-overlapping bins (dubbed ""slices"") of observation times and ensure that
each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows
one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series
classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute
individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known
class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest
neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing
features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional
uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder
long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and
classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After
illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same
architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an
imputed data set. Our experiments show an improvement over standard mean and
median imputation techniques by allowing a wider class of patient trajectories
to be recognized by the model, as well as improvement over aggregated
classification models.","['cs.LG', 'physics.bio-ph', 'q-bio.QM', 'stat.ML']",2022-01-14,2201.05634,,"['Andrew Baumgartner', 'Sevda Molani', 'Qi Wei', 'Jennifer Hadlock']",2022,1

  at the nanoscale","DNA is strong polyelectrolyte macromolecule making metal ions (counterions)
condense to a cloud around the double helix. The counterions may be localized
outside the macromolecule and inside the minor and major grooves of the double
helix. In the present work, the distribution of condensed counterions between
inner and outer regions of DNA has been studied using the approaches of
counterion condensation theory. The results have shown that the number of
counterions trapped inside the macromolecule should be greater than 0.16 per
one phosphate group. The maximal number of counterions that may be localized
inside the DNA double helix is limited to about 0.4 per one phosphate group and
it is much lower than the total number of condensed counterions. To analyze the
structure of counterion cloud the molecular dynamics simulations of
\emph{B}-DNA with K$^{+}$ counterions have been performed. The obtained number
of the counterions trapped inside the grooves of the double helix is about
0.22$\pm$0.06 per one phosphate group that agree with the model estimations.

better than lateral flow immuno-assays (LFIA). Here, we describe an optimized

much broader dynamic range than a commercial ELISA test and performs at least
as well in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Also, it is more sensitive and
quantitative than the hemagglutination-based test HAT, which we described
recently. The Jurkat-flow test requires only a few microliters of blood; thus,
it can be used to quantify various Ig isotypes in capillary blood collected
from a finger prick. It can be used also to evaluate serological responses in
mice, hamsters, cats and dogs. FACS tests offer a very attractive solution for

that are different from the the biological ones while still producing the same

mathematical models which can estimate the impact of these measures while

following measures which were either considered or implemented in the UK during
the current COVID-19 pandemic: control of within- and between-household mixing
through NPIs; formation of support bubbles during lockdown periods;
out-of-household isolation (OOHI); and temporary relaxation of NPIs during
holiday periods. Our ordinary differential equation formulation and associated

54,336,336,Molecular Noise In Synaptic Communication,"In synaptic molecular communication (MC), the activation of postsynaptic
receptors by neurotransmitters (NTs) is governed by a stochastic
reaction-diffusion process. This randomness of synaptic MC contributes to the
randomness of the electrochemical downstream signal in the postsynaptic cell,
called postsynaptic membrane potential (PSP). Since the randomness of the PSP
is relevant for neural computation and learning, characterizing the statistics
of the PSP is critical. However, the statistical characterization of the
synaptic reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible
bi-molecular reaction of NTs with receptors renders the system nonlinear.
Consequently, there is currently no model available which characterizes the
impact of the statistics of postsynaptic receptor activation on the PSP. In
this work, we propose a novel statistical model for the synaptic
reaction-diffusion process in terms of the chemical master equation (CME). We
further propose a novel numerical method which allows to compute the CME
efficiently and we use this method to characterize the statistics of the PSP.
Finally, we present results from stochastic particle-based computer simulations
which validate the proposed models. We show that the biophysical parameters
governing synaptic transmission shape the autocovariance of the receptor
activation and, ultimately, the statistics of the PSP. Our results suggest that
the processing of the synaptic signal by the postsynaptic cell effectively
mitigates synaptic noise while the statistical characteristics of the synaptic
signal are preserved. The results presented in this paper contribute to a
better understanding of the impact of the randomness of synaptic signal
transmission on neuronal information processing.","['q-bio.SC', 'cs.ET']",2022-01-14,2201.05431,,"['Sebastian Lotter', 'Maximilian Schäfer', 'Robert Schober']",2022,1

potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to
understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In
coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part

dynamics on graphs. A single ""mutant"" (e.g., a new opinion, strain, social
trait etc.) invades a population of residents spread over the nodes of a graph.
The mutant fitness advantage $\delta\geq 0$ determines how aggressively mutants
propagate to their neighbors. The quantity of interest is the fixation
probability, i.e., the probability that the initial mutant eventually takes
over the whole population. However, in realistic settings, the invading mutant
has an advantage only in certain locations. E.g., a bacterial mutation allowing
for lactose metabolism only confers an advantage on places where dairy products
are present. In this paper we introduce the positional Moran process, a natural
generalization in which the mutant fitness advantage is only realized on
specific nodes called active nodes. The associated optimization problem is
fixation maximization: given a budget $k$, choose a set of $k$ active nodes
that maximize the fixation probability of the invading mutant. We show that the
problem is NP-hard, while the optimization function is not submodular, thus
indicating strong computational hardness. Then we focus on two natural limits.
In the limit of $\delta\to\infty$ (strong selection), although the problem
remains NP-hard, the optimization function becomes submodular and thus admits a
constant-factor approximation using a simple greedy algorithm. In the limit of
$\delta\to 0$ (weak selection), we show that in $O(m^\omega)$ time we can
obtain a tight approximation, where $m$ is the number of edges and $\omega$ is

  prediction accuracy in radiotherapy","Longitudinal gross tumour volume (GTV) clinical data from head and neck
cancer patients show that tumours of a similar size and stage pre-treatment may
respond very differently to the same radiotherapy fractionation protocol.
Mathematical models of radiation response are often proposed as a means to
predict treatment outcome and prescribe more personalised fractionation
protocols. Predictive mathematical models aimed towards clinical applications
should be sufficiently detailed to capture the range of dynamics observed in
vivo while being sufficiently simple such that the model parameters are
identifiable with respect to the data typically available for model
calibration.
  In this paper we show that models describing the spatiotemporal heterogeneity
of the intratumoural composition may better capture observed in vivo dynamics
than those describing the evolution of the tumour volume alone. We compare the
range of qualitative responses with respect to GTV data throughout radiotherapy
treatment to those observed in a cohort of head and neck cancer patients.
Synthetic data studies are used to address questions of identifiability and

activity generically arise in many contexts including neuron firing, social
contagions, epidemics, and critical infrastructure failures. These phenomena
are in direct competition and represent a frustration between the network's
geometry and topology. Here, we extend their study to systems with higher-order
interactions by analyzing cascades over noisy geometric complexes, which
contain short- and long-range `simplices' that encode dyadic, triadic, and
high-order dependencies. We present a simplicial threshold model (STM) for
cascades in which a vertex $v_i$ becomes active only when the activity across
its simplicial neighbors -- including adjacent 1-simplices, 2-simplices, etc.
-- surpasses a threshold $T_i$. We show that higher-order interactions and
thresholding can coordinate to robustly guide cascades along a geometric
substrate comprised of lower-adjacent simplices despite the presence of
long-range simplices. We explore this phenomenon for a simplicial-complex-based
model of a neuronal network, i.e., a neuronal complex, revealing that
higher-order interactions also promote the expressiveness and efficiency of
diverse spatio-temporal patterns. We support these findings with bifurcation
theory to predict wavefront and clustering dynamics as well as introduce
simplicial cascade maps that embed simplicial complexes with a latent geometry
in which pairwise distances reflect the time required for STM cascades to
travel between vertices. Our findings and proposed mathematical tools reveal
the dynamical/structural interplay of higher-order nonlinearity and the

possible, however, there are limits to sparsification. Specifically, as the
number of connections falls below a critical threshold, flight performance
drops considerably. We develop sparsification paradigms and explore their
limits for control tasks. Monte Carlo simulations also quantify the statistical
distribution of network weights during pruning given initial random weights of
the DNNs. We demonstrate that on average, the network can be pruned to retain
approximately 7% of the original network weights, with statistical

diet + feed additive at a 0.05% inclusion rate. The experimental units were
broiler houses (7 experiments), floor pens (1 experiment) and cages (1

completely randomized non-blocked or blocked designs, respectively. The
meta-analyses were performed in R programming language. Results: No
statistically significant effects were found in the evaluated variables in any

  coupling","In this paper we analyze the relaxation to steady-state of intracellular
diffusion in a pair of cells with gap-junction coupling. Gap junctions are
prevalent in most animal organs and tissues, providing a direct diffusion
pathway for both electrical and chemical communication between cells. Most
analytical models of gap junctions focus on the steady-state diffusive flux and
the associated effective diffusivity. Here we investigate the relaxation to
steady state in terms of the so-called local accumulation time. The latter is
commonly used to estimate the time to form a protein concentration gradient
during morphogenesis. The basic idea is to treat the fractional deviation from
the steady-state concentration as a cumulative distribution for the local
accumulation time. One of the useful features of the local accumulation time is
that it takes into account the fact that different spatial regions can relax at
different rates. We consider both static and dynamic gap junction models. The
former treats the gap junction as a resistive channel with effective
permeability $\mu$, whereas the latter represents the gap junction as a
stochastic gate that randomly switches between an open and closed state. The
local accumulation time is calculated by solving the diffusion equation in
Laplace space and then taking the small-$s$ limit. We show that the
accumulation time is a monotonically increasing function of spatial position,
with a jump discontinuity at the gap junction. This discontinuity vanishes in
the limit $\mu \rightarrow \infty$ for a static junction and $\beta \rightarrow
0$ for a stochastically-gated junction, where $\beta$ is the rate at which the
gate closes.
  Finally, our results are generalized to the case of a linear array of cells
with nearest neighbor gap junction coupling.","['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'q-bio.QM']",2022-01-05,2201.01691,,['Paul C. Bressloff'],2022,1

""information transfer"" from a source to a target signal by ignoring
self-predictability of a target signal when quantifying the source-target
relationship. A simple example for signals with such self-predictability are
narrowband signals. These are both thought to be intrinsically generated by the
brain as well as commonly dealt with in analyses of brain signals, where
band-pass filters are used to separate responses from noise. However, the use
of Transfer Entropy is usually discouraged in such cases. We simulate
simplistic examples where we confirm the failure of classic implementations of
Transfer Entropy when applied to narrow-band signals, as made evident by a
flawed recovery of effect sizes and interaction delays. We propose an
alternative approach based on a whitening of the input signals before computing
a bivariate measure of directional time-lagged dependency. This approach solves
the problems found in the simple simulated systems. Finally, we explore the
behaviour of our measure when applied to delta and theta response components in
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to continuous speech. The small effects
that our measure attributes to a directed interaction from the stimulus to the
neuronal responses are stronger in the theta than in the delta band. This
suggests that the delta band reflects a more predictive coupling, while the
theta band is stronger involved in bottom-up, reactive processing. Taken

  reactive targets","A general topic of current interest is the analysis of diffusion problems in
singularly perturbed domains with small interior targets or traps (the narrow
capture problem). One major application is to intracellular diffusion, where
the targets typically represent some form of reactive biochemical substrate.
Most studies of the narrow capture problem treat the target boundaries as
totally absorbing. In this paper, we analyze the three-dimensional narrow
capture problem in the more realistic case of partially reactive target
boundaries. We begin by considering classical Robin boundary conditions.
Matching inner and outer solutions of the single-particle probability density,
we derive an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed flux into each
reactive surface in powers of $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon \rho$ is a given
target size. In turn, the fluxes determine the splitting probabilities for
target absorption. We then extend our analysis to more general types of
reactive targets by combining matched asymptotic analysis with an
encounter-based formulation of diffusion-mediated surface reactions. That is,
we derive an asymptotic expansion of the joint probability density for particle
position and the boundary local time. The effects of surface reactions are then
incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition for the boundary local time.
Finally, we illustrate the theory by exploring how the leading-order
contributions to the splitting probabilities depend on the choice of surface
reactions. In particular, we show that there is an effective renormalization of
the target radius of the form $\rho\rightarrow \rho-\widetilde{\Psi}(1/\rho)$,
where $\widetilde{\Psi}$ is the Laplace transform of the stopping local time
distribution.","['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'q-bio.QM']",2022-01-05,2201.01675,,['Paul C. Bressloff'],2022,1

  Feynman-Kac formula","Many processes in cell biology involve diffusion in a domain $\Omega$ that
contains a target $\calU$ whose boundary $\partial \calU$ is a chemically
reactive surface. Such a target could represent a single reactive molecule, an
intracellular compartment or a whole cell. Recently, a probabilistic framework
for studying diffusion-mediated surface reactions has been developed that
considers the joint probability density or propagator for the particle position
and the so-called boundary local time. The latter characterizes the amount of
time that a Brownian particle spends in the neighborhood of a point on a
totally reflecting boundary. The effects of surface reactions are then
incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition for the boundary local time.
In this paper we generalize the theory of diffusion-mediated surface reactions
to cases where the whole interior target domain $\calU$ acts as a partial
absorber rather than the target boundary $\partial \calU$. Now the particle can
freely enter and exit $\calU$, and is only able to react (be absorbed) within
$\calU$. The appropriate Brownian functional is then the occupation time
(accumulated time that the particle spends within $\calU$) rather than the
boundary local time. We show that both cases can be considered within a unified
framework by using a Feynman-Kac formula to derive a boundary value problem
(BVP) for the propagator of the corresponding Brownian functional, and
introducing an associated stopping condition. We illustrate the theory by
calculating the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a spherical target $\calU$
located at the center of a spherical domain $\Omega$. This is achieved by
solving the propagator BVP directly, rather than using spectral methods. We
find that if the first moment of the stopping time density is infinite, then
the MFPT is also infinite, that is, the spherical target is not sufficiently
absorbing.","['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'q-bio.QM']",2022-01-05,2201.01671,,['Paul C. Bressloff'],2022,1

into a multiset $Y'\subseteq X$ of products. RNs are equivalent to directed
hypergraphs. However, not all RNs necessarily admit a chemical interpretation.
Instead, they might contradict fundamental principles of physics such as the
conservation of energy and mass or the reversibility of chemical reactions. The
consequences of these necessary conditions for the stoichiometric matrix
$\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{X\times\mathscr{R}}$ have been discussed
extensively in the literature. Here, we provide sufficient conditions for
$\mathbf{S}$ that guarantee the interpretation of RNs in terms of balanced sum
formulas and structural formulas, respectively.
  Chemically plausible RNs allow neither a perpetuum mobile, i.e., a ""futile
cycle"" of reactions with non-vanishing energy production, nor the creation or
annihilation of mass. Such RNs are said to be thermodynamically sound and
conservative. For finite RNs, both conditions can be expressed equivalently as
properties of $\mathbf{S}$. The first condition is vacuous for reversible
networks, but it excludes irreversible futile cycles and - in a stricter sense
- futile cycles that even contain an irreversible reaction. The second
condition is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive reaction
invariant. Furthermore, it is sufficient for the existence of a realization in
terms of sum formulas, obeying conservation of ""atoms"". In particular, these
realizations can be chosen such that any two species have distinct sum

comparatively large particles by the cell, that plays a central role in the
functioning of our immune system. We study the process of phagocytosis by
considering a simplified coarse grained model of a three-dimensional vesicle,
having uniform adhesion interaction with a rigid particle, in the presence of
curved membrane proteins and active cytoskeletal forces. Complete engulfment is
achieved when the bending energy cost of the vesicle is balanced by the gain in
the adhesion energy. The presence of curved (convex) proteins reduces the
bending energy cost by self-organizing with higher density at the highly curved
leading edge of the engulfing membrane, which forms the circular rim of the
phagocytic cup that wraps around the particle. This allows the engulfment to
occur at much smaller adhesion strength. When the curved proteins exert
outwards protrusive forces, representing actin polymerization, at the leading
edge, we find that engulfment is achieved more quickly and at lower protein
density. We consider spherical as well as non-spherical particles, and find
that non-spherical particles are more difficult to engulf in comparison to the
spherical particles of the same surface area. For non-spherical particles, the
engulfment time crucially depends upon the initial orientation of the particles

utility this mechanism for dynamic reconfiguration can bring over the widely

conduct an energetic analysis of functional brain networks using resting-state

comparing the state transition energy under distinct adjacent matrices, we
justify that dynamic functional connectivity leads to 60% less energy cost to
support the resting state dynamics than static connectivity when driving the

combining graph theoretical measurements and our energy-based control

instruction will be disastrously bad. This differs from most mainstream

to quantum complex vector spaces and quantum probability models, we showed that
quantization itself, with words as quanta, is relevant and potentially
important to human cognition. In the present work, we build on this result, and
introduce a powerful radiation quantization scheme for human cognition. We show
that the lack of independence of the Bose-Einstein statistics compared to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics can be explained by the presence of a 'meaning
dynamics', which causes words to be attracted to the same words. And so words
clump together in the same states, a phenomenon well known for photons in the
early years of quantum mechanics, leading to fierce disagreements between
Planck and Einstein. Using a simple example, we introduce all the elements to
get a better and detailed view of this 'meaning dynamics', such as micro and

connecting a concept directly to human experience, we show that entanglement is

  response and maturation more robustly than integer order models","It has recently been discovered that the viscoelastic properties of cells are
inherent markers reflecting the complex biological states, functions and
malfunctions of the cells. Although the extraction of model parameters from the
viscoelasticity data of many cell types has been done successfully using
integer order mechanical and power-law viscoelastic models, there are some cell
types and conditions where the goodness of fits falls behind. Thus, fractional
order viscoelastic models have been proposed as more general and better suited
for such modeling. In this work, we test such proposed generality using
published data already fitted by integer order models. We find that cell
viscoelasticity data can be fitted using fractional order viscoelastic models
in more situations than integer order. For macrophages, which are among the
white blood cells that function in the immune system, the fractional order
Kelvin-Voigt model best captures pharmacological interventions and maturation
of the cells. The steady state viscosity of macrophages decreases following
depolymerization of F-actin using the drug cytochalasin D, and also decreases
following myosin II breakdown using Blebbistatin. When macrophages are treated
with a bacterium-derived chemoattractant, the steady state viscosity decreases.
Interestingly, both the steady state viscosity and elastic modulus are
progressively altered as the cells become mature and approach senescence. Taken
together, these results show that fractional viscoelastic modeling, more
robustly than integer order modeling, enables the further quantification of
cell function and malfunction, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic
applications especially in cases of cancer and immune system dysfunctions.","['physics.bio-ph', 'q-bio.CB']",2022-01-02,2201.02589,,"['Anh Vo', 'Andrew Ekpenyong']",2022,1

motion term. Reducing the influence of the random perturbations, to limit
fitness decreasing and deleterious mutations, will likely imply divesting
resources to genomic repair systems. The stable mutation rates seen in many
organisms could thus be an evolved strategy to reduce the influence of the
Brownian motion term. Furthermore, if change to genomic GC content, i.e. the GC
content of variable sites or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is just as
likely to increase as to decrease, something that resembles knockout of repair
enzymes and removal of selective pressures seen in evolutionary laboratory
experiments, the species genome will likely decay unless infinite resources are
available. These implications are solely a consequence of allowing random
perturbations affect AT- and GC mutation rates and not obtainable using
standard non-stochastic methodology. Finally, a connection between the model

cells follow dynamic energy budget rules, in response to variations in
environmental concentrations of nutrients, toxicants and substances released by
the cells. In this way, we create, destroy and enlarge boundaries, either
spherical or rod-like. Appropriate forces represent details of the interaction

  Distinguish Emotional Sentiment","We routinely communicate distinct social and emotional sentiments through
nuanced touch. For example, we might gently hold another's arm to offer a sense
of calm, yet intensively hold another's arm to express excitement or anxiety.
As this example indicates, distinct sentiments may be shaped by the subtlety in
one's touch delivery. This work investigates how slight distinctions in
skin-to-skin contact influence both the recognition of cued emotional messages
(e.g., anger, sympathy) and the rating of emotional content (i.e., arousal,
valence). By self-selecting preferred gestures (e.g., holding, stroking),
touchers convey distinct messages by touching the receiver's forearm.
Skin-to-skin contact attributes (e.g., velocity, depth, area) are optically
tracked in high resolution. Contact is then examined within gesture, between
messages. The results indicate touchers subtly, but significantly, vary contact
attributes of a gesture to communicate distinct messages, which are
recognizable by receivers. This tuning also correlates with receivers' arousal
and valence. For instance, arousal increases with velocity for stroking, and
depth for holding. Moreover, as shown here with human-to-human touch, valence
is tied with velocity, which is the same trend as reported with brushes. The
findings indicate that subtle nuance in skin-to-skin contact is important in
conveying social messages and inducing emotions.","['cs.HC', 'q-bio.NC']",2022-01-07,2201.02748,10.1109/TOH.2021.3137833,"['Shan Xu', 'Chang Xu', 'Sarah McIntyre', 'Håkan Olausson', 'Gregory J. Gerling']",2022,1

a reduced incidence of disease and improved vaccine response compared to

from immune phenotyped cattle are exposed to in-vitro heat challenge, high

119,360,360,Methods for calculating coexistence mechanisms: Beyond scaling factors,"How do species coexist? A framework known as Modern Coexistence Theory
measures mechanisms of coexistence by comparing a species perturbed to low
density (the invader) to other species that remain at their typical densities
(the residents); this invader-resident comparison measures a rare-species
advantage that results from specialization. However, there are several
reasonable ways (i.e., methods) to compare invaders and residents, each
differing in practicality and biological interpretation. Here, using
theoretical arguments and case studies, we compare four such methods for
calculating coexistence mechanisms: 1) Scaling factors, the traditional
approach where resident growth rates are scaled by a measure of relative
sensitivity to competition, obtained by solving a system of linear equations;
2) The simple comparison, which gives equal weight to all resident species; 3)
Speed conversion factors, a novel method in which resident growth rates are
scaled by a ratio of generation times, and; 4) The invader-invader comparison,
another novel method in which a focal species is compared to itself at high vs.
low density. We conclude that the conventional scaling factors can be useful in
some theoretical research, but are not recommended for empirical applications,
i.e., determining the mechanisms of coexistence in real communities. Instead,
we recommend the simple comparison and speed conversion factor methods. The
speed conversion factors are most useful when comparing species with dissimilar
generation times. However, ecologists often study coexistence in guilds of
species with similar life-histories, and therefore, similar generation times.
In such scenarios, the easier-to-use simple comparison method is reasonable.","['q-bio.PE', 'q-bio.QM']",2022-01-17,2201.06666,,"['Evan Johnson', 'Alan Hastings']",2022,1
120,361,361,"The storage effect is not about bet-hedging or population
  stage-structure","The storage effect is a well-known explanation for the coexistence of
competing species in temporally varying environments. Like many complex
ecological theories, the storage effect is often used as an explanation for
observed coexistence on the basis of heuristic understanding, rather than
careful application of a detailed model. But, a careful examination of some
widely employed heuristic representations of the storage effect shows that they
can be misleading. One interpretation of the storage effect states that species
coexist by specializing on a small slice of all environmental states, and
therefore must have a robust life-stage (e.g., long-lived adults, a seedbank)
in order to ""wait it out"" for a good year. Another more general interpretation
states that ""buffering"" helps species ""wait it out"", where ""buffering"" means
populations are protected from large losses when the environment is poor and
competition is high. Here, we show that both of these conventional
interpretations are imperfect. Multiple models show that stage-structure, long
lifespans, and overlapping generations are not required for the storage effect.
Further, a species that experiences buffering necessarily grows poorly when the
environment is favorable and competition is high. We review the empirical
literature and conclude that species are likely to find themselves in this
good-environment/high-competition scenario, and therefore, that buffering tends
to hurt individual species. The buffering interpretation of the storage effect
can be thought of as conflating a community-level criterion for coexistence
with a population-level criterion for persistence; it is like claiming that
species can persist by limiting their own growth rates, since the
Lotka-Volterra model tells us that intraspecific competition must be greater
than interspecific competition.",['q-bio.PE'],2022-01-17,2201.06687,,"['Evan Johnson', 'Alan Hastings']",2022,1

  with containment measures","During the COVID pandemic, periods of exponential growth of the disease have
been mitigated by containment measures that in different occasions have
resulted in a power-law growth of the number of cases. The first observation of
such behaviour has been obtained from 2020 late spring data coming from China
by Ziff and Ziff in Ref. [1]. After this important observation the power-law
scaling (albeit with different exponents) has also been observed in other
countries during periods of containment of the spread. Early interpretations of
these results suggest that this phenomenon might be due to spatial effects of
the spread. Here we show that temporal modulations of infectivity of
individuals due to containment measures can also cause power-law growth of the
number of cases over time. To this end we propose a stochastic well-mixed
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model of epidemic spreading in presence of
containment measures resulting in time-dependent infectivity and we explore the
statistical properties of the resulting branching process at criticality. We
show that at criticality it is possible to observe power-law growth of the
number of cases with exponents ranging between one and two. Our asymptotic
analytical results are confirmed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Although
these results do not exclude that spatial effects might be important in
modulating the power-law growth of the number of cases at criticality, this
work shows that even well-mixed populations may already feature non-trivial

attractant concentration with strong and weak spatial gradient. During the
uphill and downhill motion of the cell along the gradient, we measure the
temporal variation of average methylation level of the receptor clusters. Our
numerical simulations show that the methylation dynamics depends sensitively on
the size of the receptor clusters and also on the strength of the gradient. At
short times after the beginning of a run, the methylation dynamics is mainly
controlled by short runs which are generally associated with high receptor
activity. This results in demethylation at short times. But for intermediate or
large times, long runs play an important role and depending on receptor
cooperativity or gradient strength, the qualitative variation of methylation
can be completely different in this time regime. For weak gradient, both for
uphill and downhill runs, after the initial demethylation, we find methylation
level increases steadily with time for all cluster sizes. Similar qualitative
behavior is observed for strong gradient during uphill runs as well. However,
the methylation dynamics for downhill runs in strong gradient show highly
non-trivial dependence on the receptor cluster size. We explain this behavior
as a result of interplay between the sensing and adaptation modules of the

used to fit a data set equally well, especially if the data is sparse. In such
cases, these mathematically different but similar looking functional forms are
typically considered interchangeable. Recent work, however, shows that similar
functional responses may nonetheless result in significantly different
bifurcation points for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the
bifurcation behaviours include destabilising oscillations, predicting the
occurrence of such behaviours is clearly important. Ecologically, different
bifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions may be obtained from the
models. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to the extinction
of both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions is also clearly
important for conservationists. Mathematically, this difference in bifurcation
structure given similar functional responses is called structural sensitivity.
We extend the existing work to find that the Leslie-Gower-May predator-prey
system is also structurally sensitive to the functional response. Using the
Rosenzweig-MacArthur and Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if
there is some way to obtain a functional description of data so that different
functional responses yield the same bifurcation structure, i.e., we aim to
describe data such that our model is not structurally sensitive. We analyze the
functional responses using two different methods to determine which part of
each function contributes most to the observed bifurcation behaviour. We find
that prey densities around the coexistence steady state are most important in
defining the functional response. Lastly, we propose a procedure for ecologists

noisy or approximate repeats of patterns in sparse binary data. The model is
based on the ""Noisy-OR model"" (Heckerman, 1990), used previously for disease
and topic modelling. The model's capability is demonstrated by extracting
structure in recordings from retinal neurons, but it can be widely applied to
discover and model latent structure in noisy binary data. In the context of
spiking neural data, the task is to ""explain"" spikes of individual neurons in
terms of groups of neurons, ""Cell Assemblies"" (CAs), that often fire together,
due to mutual interactions or other causes. The model infers sparse activity in
a set of binary latent variables, each describing the activity of a cell
assembly. When the latent variable of a cell assembly is active, it reduces the
probabilities of neurons belonging to this assembly to be inactive. The
conditional probability kernels of the latent components are learned from the
data in an expectation maximization scheme, involving inference of latent
states and parameter adjustments to the model. We thoroughly validate the model
on synthesized spike trains constructed to statistically resemble recorded

Bioinformatics (e.g. RNA assembly). However, because this problem and its
variants are NP-hard, practical multiassembly tools either use heuristics or
solve simpler, polynomial-time solvable versions of the problem, which may
yield solutions that are not mini-mal or do not perfectly decompose the flow.
Many RNA assemblers also use integer linear programming(ILP) formulations of
such practical variants, having the major limitation they need to encode all
the potentially exponentially many solution paths. Moreover, the only exact
solver for MFD does not scale to large instances and cannot be efficiently
generalized to practical MFD variants. In this work, we provide the first
practical ILP formulation for MFD (and thus the first fast and exact solver for
MFD), based on encoding all of the exponentially many solution paths using only
a quadratic number of variables. On both simulated and real flow graphs, our
approach solves any instance in under 13 seconds. We also show that our ILP
formulation can be easily and efficiently adapted for many practical variants,
such as incorporating longer or paired-end reads or minimizing flow errors. We
hope that our results can remove the current tradeoff between the complexity of
a multi assembly model and its tractability and can lie at the core of future
practical RNA assembly tools.","['q-bio.GN', 'math.CO', 'math.OC']",2022-01-26,2201.10923,,"['Fernando H. C. Dias', 'Lucia Williams', 'Brendan Mumey', 'Alexandru I. Tomescu']",2022,1

virtually all physiological functions, we understand surprisingly little about
what phases form in a system of many interacting components, like in cells.
Here, we introduce a new numerical method based on physical relaxation dynamics
to study the coexisting phases in such systems. We use our approach to optimize
interactions between components, similar to how evolution might have optimized
the interactions of proteins. These evolved interactions robustly lead to a
defined number of phases, despite substantial uncertainties in the initial
composition, while random or designed interactions perform much worse.
Moreover, the optimized interactions are robust to perturbations and they allow
fast adaption to new target phase counts. We thus show that genetically encoded
interactions of proteins provide versatile control of phase behavior. The
phases forming in our system are also a concrete example of a robust emergent
property that does not rely on fine-tuning the parameters of individual

  after thermal therapy","Microscale oxygenation plays a prominent role in tumour progression.
Spatiotemporal variability of oxygen distribution in the tumour
microenvironment contributes to cellular heterogeneity and to the emergence of
normoxic and hypoxic populations. Local levels of oxygen strongly affect the
response of tumours to the administration of different therapeutic modalities
and, more generally, to the phenomenon of resistance to treatments. Several
interventions have been proposed to improve tumour oxygenation, being the
elevation of the local temperature (hyperthermia) an important one. While other
factors such as the metabolic activity have to be considered, the proficiency
of the tumour vascular system is a key factor both for the tissue oxygenation
and for its temperature maps. Consequently, the interplay of these factors has
attracted considerable attention from the mathematical modelling perspective.
Here we put forward a transport-based system of partial differential equations
aimed at describing the dynamics of healthy and tumour cell subpopulations at
the microscale in a region placed between two blood vessels. By using this
model with diverse flow conditions, we analyse the oxygen and temperature
profiles that arise in different scenarios of vascular status, both during free
progression and under thermal therapy. We find that low oxygen levels are
associated to elevations of temperature in locations preferentially populated
by hypoxic cells, and hyperthermia-induced cell death, being strongly dependent
on blood flow, would only appear under highly disrupted conditions of the local
vasculature. This results in a noticeable effect of heat on hypoxic cells.
Additionally, when pronounced cell death occurs, it is followed by a
significant increase in the oxygen levels.","['q-bio.TO', 'q-bio.PE']",2022-01-10,2201.11584,,"['Jesús J. Bosque', 'Gabriel F. Calvo', 'María Cruz Navarro']",2022,1

Some applications require any decomposition that is optimal w.r.t. some
property such as number of paths, robustness, or length. Many bioinformatic
applications require a specific decomposition where the paths correspond to
some underlying data that generated the flow. For real inputs, no optimization
criteria guarantees to uniquely identify the correct decomposition. Therefore,
we propose to report safe paths, i.e., subpaths of at least one path in every
flow decomposition.
  Ma, Zheng, and Kingsford [WABI 2020] addressed the existence of multiple
optimal solutions in a probabilistic framework, i.e., non-identifiability.
Later [RECOMB 2021], they gave a quadratic-time algorithm based on a global
criterion for solving a problem called AND-Quant, which generalizes the problem
of reporting whether a given path is safe.
  We give the first local characterization of safe paths for flow
decompositions in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), leading to a practical
algorithm for finding the complete set of safe paths. We evaluated our
algorithms against the trivial safe algorithms (unitigs, extended unitigs) and
the popularly used heuristic (greedy-width) for flow decomposition on RNA
transcripts datasets. Despite maintaining perfect precision our algorithm
reports significantly higher coverage ($\approx 50\%$ more) than trivial safe
algorithms. The greedy-width algorithm though reporting a better coverage, has
significantly lower precision on complex graphs. Overall, our algorithm
outperforms (by $\approx 20\%$) greedy-width on a unified metric (F-Score) when
the dataset has significant number of complex graphs. Moreover, it has superior
time ($3-5\times$) and space efficiency ($1.2-2.2\times$), resulting in a
better and more practical approach for bioinformatics applications of flow

including in children. The traditional method for processing acceleration data
uses cut points to define physical activity intensity, relying on calibration
studies that relate the magnitude of acceleration to energy expenditure.
However, these relationships do not generalise across diverse populations and
hence they must be parametrised for each subpopulation (e.g., age groups) which
is costly and makes studies across diverse populations and over time difficult.
A data driven approach that allows physical activity intensity states to emerge
from the data, without relying on parameters derived from external populations,
and offers a new perspective on this problem and potentially improved results.
We applied an unsupervised machine learning approach, namely a hidden semi
Markov model, to segment and cluster the accelerometer data recorded from 279
children (9 to 38 months old) with a diverse range of physical and
social-cognitive abilities (measured using the Paediatric Evaluation of
Disability Inventory). We benchmarked this analysis with the cut points
approach calculated using the best available thresholds for the population.
Time spent active as measured by this unsupervised approach correlated more
strongly with measures of the childs mobility, social-cognitive capacity,
independence, daily activity, and age than that measured using the cut points
approach. Unsupervised machine learning offers the potential to provide a more

chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor neuron involvement (55%),
dysautonomia (50%), and parkinsonism (10%). Motor neuron involvement was found

Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 patient with an enriched phenotype,

associated with the time since implantation (8 and 9 patients for state
occurrence and state duration, respectively). Additionally, some patients also
had one or more states that were associated with phases of circadian and/or
multidien spike rate cycles (4 and 7 patients for state occurrence and state

usually associated with the same timescale.
  Our results suggest that time-varying factors modulate within-patient seizure

150,362,362,Towards a heuristic understanding of the storage effect,"The storage effect is a general explanation for coexistence in a variable
environment. The generality of the storage effect is both a strength - it can
be quantified in many systems - and a challenge - there is not a clear
relationship between the abstract conditions for storage effect and species'
life-history traits (e.g., dormancy, stage-structure, non-overlapping
generations), thus precluding a simple ecological interpretation of the storage
effect. Our goal here is to provide a clearer understanding of the conditions
for the storage effect as a step towards a better general explanation for
coexistence in a variable environment. Our approach focuses on dividing one of
the key conditions for the storage effect, covariance between environment and
competition, into two pieces, namely that there must be a causal relationship
between environment and competition, and that the effects of the environment do
not change too quickly. This finer-grained definition can explain a number of
previous results, including 1) that the storage effect promotes annual plant
coexistence when the germination rate fluctuates, but not when the seed yield
fluctuates, 2) that the storage effect is more likely to be induced by resource
competition than apparent competition, and 3) that the spatial storage effect
is more probable than the temporal storage effect. Additionally, our expanded
definition suggests two novel mechanisms by which the temporal storage effect
can arise: transgenerational plasticity, and causal chains of environmental
variables. These mechanisms produce coexistence via the storage effect without
any need for stage structure or a temporally autocorrelated environment.",['q-bio.PE'],2022-01-17,2201.06691,,"['Evan Johnson', 'Alan Hastings']",2022,1
151,471,471,"AntBO: Towards Real-World Automated Antibody Design with Combinatorial
  Bayesian Optimisation","Antibodies are canonically Y-shaped multimeric proteins capable of highly
specific molecular recognition. The CDRH3 region located at the tip of variable
chains of an antibody dominates antigen-binding specificity. Therefore, it is a
priority to design optimal antigen-specific CDRH3 regions to develop
therapeutic antibodies to combat harmful pathogens. However, the combinatorial
nature of CDRH3 sequence space makes it impossible to search for an optimal
binding sequence exhaustively and efficiently, especially not experimentally.
Here, we present AntBO: a Combinatorial Bayesian Optimisation framework
enabling efficient in silico design of the CDRH3 region. Ideally, antibodies
should bind to their target antigen and be free from any harmful outcomes.
Therefore, we introduce the CDRH3 trust region that restricts the search to
sequences with feasible developability scores. To benchmark AntBO, we use the
Absolut! software suite as a black-box oracle because it can score the target
specificity and affinity of designed antibodies in silico in an unconstrained
fashion. The results across 188 antigens demonstrate the benefit of AntBO in
designing CDRH3 regions with diverse biophysical properties. In under 200
protein designs, AntBO can suggest antibody sequences that outperform the best
binding sequence drawn from 6.9 million experimentally obtained CDRH3s and a
commonly used genetic algorithm baseline. Additionally, AntBO finds very-high
affinity CDRH3 sequences in only 38 protein designs whilst requiring no domain
knowledge. We conclude AntBO brings automated antibody design methods closer to
what is practically viable for in vitro experimentation.","['q-bio.BM', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE', 'stat.ML']",2022-01-29,2201.1257,,"['Asif Khan', 'Alexander I.

human nervous system in both health and disease. Such connectivity can be
inferred non-invasively by analyzing the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal
from functional magnetic resonance imaging. However, approaches to quantify
this connectivity must solve an under-constrained problem with several
potential solutions due to noise and spatial resolution limitations during
imaging. Previous research has insufficiently evaluated the reproducibility of
the traditional approaches and these approaches have been insufficiently
regularized to increase solution stability. We propose three new measures of
correlative and causal connectivity which incorporate explicit regularization
through a structural connectivity prior from diffusion MRI. These new measures,
which exploit a machine learning formulation for efficient computation, are
evaluated against traditional measures for reproducibility and predictive
power. In particular, correlation, partial correlation, spectral density, and a
novel measure of functional connectivity based on machine learning feature
importance (MLFC) are compared. Additionally, measures of effective
connectivity are compared to two proposed connectivity measures: a machine
learning approach and a Granger-causal approach incorporating a low-dimensional
projection with a diffusion MRI-derived tractography prior. In addition to
reproducibility, we quantify the capacity each measures has to infer three
study participant traits: a physiologic trait, a cognitive trait, and a
combined physiologic and cognitive trait. The proposed measures prove to be

Antithetic Integral Controller (AIC) is innocuous under very mild conditions on

the open-loop network, and the admissibility of the set-point value. We show
here that the class of p-type AIC controllers arising in the use of Antithetic
Integral Rein Controllers (AIRC) also exhibit such a property. It is shown in
the unimolecular reaction network case that the closed-loop network is
structurally stable with respect to the controller parameters provided that the

Michaelis-Menten or Hill kinetics), it is desirable to extend CLUE to the

  productive elongation to be a highly punctual process","Gene transcription is a stochastic process that involves thousands of
reactions. The first set of these reactions, which happen near a gene promoter,
are considered to be the most important in the context of stochastic noise. The
most common models of transcription are primarily concerned with the effect of
activators/repressors on the overall transcription rate and approximate the
basal transcription processes as a one step event. According to such effective
models, the Fano factor of mRNA copy distributions is always greater than
(super-Poissonian) or equal to 1 (Poissonian), and the only way to go below
this limit (sub-Poissonian) is via a negative feedback. It is partly due to
this limit that the first stage of transcription is held responsible for most
of the stochastic noise in mRNA copy numbers. However, by considering all major
reactions that build and drive the basal transcription machinery, from the
first protein that binds a promoter to the entrance of the transcription
complex (TC) into productive elongation, it is shown that the first two stages
of transcription, namely the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and the
promoter proximal pausing (PPP), is a highly punctual process. In other words,
the time between the first and the last step of this process is narrowly
distributed, which gives rise to sub-Poissonian distributions for the number of
TCs that have entered productive elongation. In fact, having simulated the PIC
formation and the PPP via the Gillespie algorithm using 2000 distinct parameter
sets and 4 different reaction network topologies, it is shown that only 4.4%
give rise to a Fano factor that is > 1 with the upper bound of 1.7, while for
31% of cases the Fano factor is below 0.5, with 0.19 as the lower bound. These

penalizes the variational free energy, which results in low-complexity
solutions. We further used the power-law spectral framework as a powerful tool

a subset of an EU longitudinal depression study with 215 participants and their
phone-collected acceleration signals (average 463 hours per participant). We
detected participants' gait cycles and force from acceleration signals and
extracted 20 statistics-based daily-life gait features to describe the

over the past decades. Despite this progress, there are still many obstacles to
fully understanding how radiation interacts with biologically relevant cellular
components to form observable endpoints. One hurdle is the difficulty faced by
members of different research groups in directly comparing results. Multiple
Monte Carlo codes have been developed to simulate damage induction at the DNA
scale, while at the same time various groups have developed models that
describe DNA repair processes with varying levels of detail. These repair
models are intrinsically linked to the damage model employed in their
development, making it difficult to disentangle systematic effects in either
part of the modelling chain. The modelling chain typically consists of track
structure Monte Carlo simulations of the physics interactions creating direct
damages to the DNA; followed by simulations of the production and initial
reactions of chemical species causing indirect damages. After the DNA damage
induction, DNA repair models combine the simulated damage patterns with
biological models to determine the biological consequences of the damage. We
propose a new Standard data format for DNA Damage to unify the interface
between the simulation of damage induction and the biological modelling of cell
repair processes. Such a standard greatly facilitates inter model comparisons,
providing an ideal environment to tease out model assumptions and identify
persistent, underlying mechanisms. Through inter model comparisons, this
unified standard has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the

external input is dynamically canceled by recurrent feedback, it is far easier
to suppress chaos with independent inputs into each neuron than through common

to the transmission of beneficial microbes and to diversifying host

pathogen resistance and optimal health and thus translate into positive fitness
outcomes. This mechanism relies on two emerging findings from empirical

vertical and horizontal routes, and (ii) play a pervasive role in host
development, physiology, metabolism, and susceptibility to pathogens. We
suggest that the social transmission of microbiomes has the potential to

  among mixed-type biological traits","Inferring correlation among mixed-type biological traits while controlling
for the evolutionary relationship among taxa is of great scientific interest
yet remains computationally challenging. The recently developed phylogenetic
multivariate probit model accommodates binary and continuous traits by assuming
latent parameters underlying binary traits. The most expensive inference step
is to sample the latent parameters from their conditional posterior that is a
high dimensional truncated normal. The current best approach uses the bouncy
particle sampler (BPS) optimized with a linear-order gradient evaluation method
that employs a dynamic programming strategy on the directed acyclic structure
of the phylogeny. Despite its significant improvement upon previous methods,
with increasing sample sizes BPS encounters difficulty in exploring the
parameter space and fails to provide reliable estimates for the across-trait
partial correlation that describes the direct effects among traits. We develop
a new inference scheme that highlights Zigzag Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(Zigzag-HMC), a variant of traditional HMC that uses Laplace momentum.
Zigzag-HMC can utilize the same gradient evaluation method that speeds up BPS,
yet it is much more efficient. We further improve the efficiency by jointly
updating the latent parameters and correlation elements using a differential
operator splitting technique. In an application exploring HIV-1 evolution that
requires joint sampling from a 11,235-dimensional truncated normal and a
24-dimensional covariance matrix, our method yields a $ 5\times $ speedup

Theory (MCT), a quantitative framework for understanding ecological
coexistence. In order to use MCT to infer how species are coexisting, one must
relate a complex model (which simulates coexistence in the real world) to
simple models in which previously proposed explanations for coexistence have
been codified. This can be accomplished in three steps: 1) relating the
construct of coexistence to invasion growth rates, 2) mathematically
partitioning the invasion growth rates into coexistence mechanisms (i.e.,
classes of explanations for coexistence), and 3) relating coexistence
mechanisms to simple explanations for coexistence. Previous research has
primarily focused on step 2. Here, we discuss the other crucial steps and their
implications for inferring the mechanisms of coexistence in real communities.
  Our discussion of step 3 -- relating coexistence mechanisms to simple
explanations for coexistence -- serves a heuristic guide for hypothesizing
about the causes of coexistence in new models; but also addresses
misconceptions about coexistence mechanisms. For example, the storage effect
has little to do with bet-hedging or ""storage"" via a robust life-history stage;
relative nonlinearity is more likely to promote coexistence than originally
thought; and fitness-density covariance is an amalgam of a large number of
previously proposed explanations for coexistence (e.g., the
competition-colonization trade-off, heteromyopia, spatially-varying resource
supply ratios). Additionally, we review a number of topics in MCT, including
the role of ""scaling factors""; whether coexistence mechanisms are
approximations; whether the magnitude or sign of invasion growth rates matters
more; whether Hutchinson solved the paradox of the plankton; the

come under scrutiny, with studies questioning cross-software comparability, the
validity of statistical inference and interpretation, and the influence of the
spatial filter size on neuroimaging analyses. As most fMRI studies only use a
single filter for analysis, much information on the size and shape of the BOLD
signal in Gaussian scale space remains hidden and constrains the interpretation
of fMRI studies. To investigate the influence of the spatial observation scale
on fMRI analysis, we use a spatial multiscale analysis with a range of Gaussian
filters from 1-20 mm (full width at half maximum) to analyze fMRI data from a
speech repetition paradigm in 25 healthy subjects. We show that analyzing the
fMRI data over a range of Gaussian filter kernels reveals substantial
variability in the neuroanatomical localization and the average signal strength
and size of suprathreshold clusters depending on the filter size. We also
demonstrate how small spatial filters bias the results towards subcortical and
cerebellar clusters. Furthermore, we describe substantially different

medical challenges. The ability to design novel proteins tailored for specific
purposes could transform our ability to respond timely to these issues. Recent
advances in the field of artificial intelligence are now setting the stage to
make this goal achievable. Protein sequences are inherently similar to natural
languages: Amino acids arrange in a multitude of combinations to form
structures that carry function, the same way as letters form words and
sentences that carry meaning. Therefore, it is not surprising that throughout
the history of Natural Language Processing (NLP), many of its techniques have
been applied to protein research problems. In the last few years, we have
witnessed revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of NLP. The implementation
of Transformer pre-trained models has enabled text generation with human-like
capabilities, including texts with specific properties such as style or
subject. Motivated by its considerable success in NLP tasks, we expect
dedicated Transformers to dominate custom protein sequence generation in the
near future. Finetuning pre-trained models on protein families will enable the
extension of their repertoires with novel sequences that could be highly
divergent but still potentially functional. The combination of control tags
such as cellular compartment or function will further enable the controllable
design of novel protein functions. Moreover, recent model interpretability
methods will allow us to open the 'black box' and thus enhance our
understanding of folding principles. While early initiatives show the enormous
potential of generative language models to design functional sequences, the

193,378,378,"Critical periods and Autism Spectrum Disorders, a role for sleep","Brain development relies on both experience and genetically defined programs.
Time windows where certain brain circuits are particularly receptive to
external stimuli, resulting in heightened plasticity, are referred to as
critical periods. Sleep is thought to be essential for normal brain
development. Importantly, studies have shown that sleep enhances critical
period plasticity and promotes experience-dependent synaptic pruning in the
developing mammalian brain. Therefore, normal plasticity during critical
periods depends on proper sleep. Problems falling and staying asleep occur at a
higher rate in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relative to typical development.
In this review, we explore the potential link between sleep, critical period
plasticity, and ASD. First, we review the importance of critical period
plasticity in typical development and the role of sleep in this process. Next,
we summarize the evidence linking ASD with deficits in synaptic plasticity in
rodent models of high-confident ASD gene candidates. We then show that almost
all the high-confidence rodent models of ASD that show sleep deficits also
display plasticity deficits. Given how important sleep is for critical period
plasticity, it is essential to understand the connections between synaptic
plasticity, sleep, and brain development in ASD. However, studies investigating
sleep or plasticity during critical periods in ASD mouse models are lacking.
Therefore, we highlight an urgent need to consider developmental trajectory in
studies of sleep and plasticity in neurodevelopmental disorders.",['q-bio.NC'],2022-01-18,2201.0732,,"['Elizabeth Medina', 'Sarah Peterson', 'Kristan Singletary', 'Lucia Peixoto']",2022,1
194,376,376,"Biophysical and Biochemical mechanisms underlying Collective Cell
  Migration in Cancer Metastasis","Multicellular collective migration is a ubiquitous strategy of cells to
translocate spatially in diverse tissue environments to accomplish a wide
variety of biological phenomena, viz. embryonic development, wound healing, and
tumor progression. Diverse cellular functions and behaviors, for instance, cell
protrusions, active contractions, cell-cell adhesion, biochemical signaling,
remodeling of tissue micro-environment, etc., play their own role concomitantly
to have a single concerted consequence of multicellular migration. Thus
unveiling the driving principles, both biochemical and biophysical, of the
inherently complex process of collective cell migration is an insurmountable
task. Mathematical and computational models, in tandem with experimental data,
help in shedding some light on it. Here we review different factors influencing
Collective Cell Migration and then focus on different mathematical and
computational models - discrete, hybrid, and continuum - which helps in
revealing different aspects of multicellular migration. Finally, we discuss the
applications of these modeling frameworks specific to cancer","['q-bio.CB', 'physics.bio-ph', 'q-bio.QM']",2022-01-18,2201.07283,,"['Ushasi Roy', 'Tyler Collins', 'Mohit K. Jolly', 'Parag Katira']",2022,1
195,421,421,"Deciphering dynamics of recent COVID-19 outbreak in India: An
  age-structured modeling","Infectious disease transmission dynamics are particularly sensitive to social
contact patterns, and the precautions people take to limit disease
transmission. It depends on the age distribution of the community. Thus,
knowing the age$-$specific prevalence and incidence of infectious diseases is
critical for predicting future disease burden and the efficacy of interventions
like immunization. This study uses an SEIR age$-$structured multi-group
epidemic model to understand how social contact affects disease control. We
created location$-$specific social contact matrices in the community to see how
social mixing has affected illness spread. We estimated the basic reproduction
number $(R_0)$ of the system and plotted its global behavior in terms of $R_0$.
Optimal control for the problem has also been established quantitatively. The
proposed model's transmission rate for India from September 1, 2020, to
December 31, 2020, has also been estimated. We replicated the lifting of
non-pharmaceutical therapies by allowing participants to return to work in
phases and studied the impact of this. Our findings imply that identifying
symptomatic sick people aged $20-49$ can help lower the number of infected
people when schools are closed. When some schools are partially open, awareness
of symptomatic infected persons helps reduce cases. The simulation results also
suggest that limiting contact at school and other meeting areas could
significantly lower the number of instances. Using the least square approach,
it was discovered that the time$-$dependent transmission rate is more realistic
than the constant spread rate for COVID$-19$ in India. To reduce the COVID$-19$
in burden, we found that gradually loosening control methods could flatten and
lower other peaks. Our findings may help health policymakers decide on timely
age$-$based immunization distribution strategies and hence control the disease.",['q-bio.PE'],2022-01-24,2201.09803,,"['Vijay Pal Bajiya', 'Jai Prakash Tripathi', 'Ranjit Kumar Upadhyay']",2022,1

197,374,374,"The influence of spatial configuration in collective transitions: the
  importance of being sorted","We studied the effects of spatial configuration on collective dynamics in a
nearest-neighbour and diffusively coupled lattice of heterogeneous nodes. The
networks contained nodes from two populations, which differed in their
intrinsic excitability. Initially, these populations were uniformly and
randomly distributed throughout the lattice. We then developed an iterative
algorithm for perturbing the arrangement of the network such that nodes from
the same population were increasingly likely to be adjacent to one another. We
found that the global input strength, or network drive, necessary to transition
the network from a state of quiescence to a state of synchronised and
oscillatory activity was decreased as network sortedness was increased.
Moreover, for weak coupling, we found that regimes of partial synchronisation
exist (i.e., 2:1 resonance in the activity of the two populations), which were
dependent both on network drive (sometimes in a non-monotonic fashion) and
network sortedness.",['q-bio.QM'],2022-01-17,2201.07225,,"['Daniel Galvis', 'David J. Hodson', 'Kyle C. A. Wedgwood']",2022,1
198,372,372,"Dynamics of an SIRWS model with waning of immunity and varying immune
  boosting period","SIRS models capture transmission dynamics of infectious diseases for which
immunity is not lifelong. Extending these models by a W compartment for
individuals with waning immunity, the boosting of the immune system upon
repeated exposure may be incorporated. Previous analyses assumed identical
waning rates from R to W and from W to S. This implicitly assumes equal length
for the period of full immunity and of waned immunity. We relax this
restriction, and allow an asymmetric partitioning of the total immune period.
Stability switches of the endemic equilibrium are investigated with a
combination of analytic and numerical tools. Then, continuation methods are
applied to track bifurcations along the equilibrium branch. We find rich
dynamics: Hopf bifurcations, endemic double bubbles, and regions of
bistability. Our results highlight that the length of the period in which
waning immunity can be boosted is a crucial parameter significantly influencing
long term epidemiological dynamics.","['q-bio.PE', 'cs.CY', 'math.DS']",2022-01-18,2201.07137,,"['Richmond Opoku-Sarkodie', 'Ferenc A. Bartha', 'Mónika Polner', 'Gergely Röst']",2022,1
199,371,371,Retina organoids: Window into the biophysics of neuronal systems,"With a kind of magnetism, the human retina draws the eye of neuroscientist
and physicist alike. It is attractive as a self-organizing system, which forms
as a part of the central nervous system via biochemical and mechanical cues.
The retina is also intriguing as an electro-optical device, converting photons
into voltages to perform on-the-fly filtering before the signals are sent to
our brain. Here, we consider how the advent of stem cell derived in vitro
analogs of the retina, termed retina organoids, opens up an exploration of the
interplay between optics, electrics, and mechanics in a complex neuronal
network, all in a Petri dish. This review presents state-of-the-art retina
organoid protocols by emphasizing links to the biochemical and mechanical
signals of in vivo retinogenesis. Electrophysiological recording of active
signal processing becomes possible as retina organoids generate light sensitive
and synaptically connected photoreceptors. Experimental biophysical tools
provide data to steer the development of mathematical models operating at
different levels of coarse-graining. In concert, they provide a means to study
how mechanical factors guide retina self-assembly. In turn, this understanding
informs the engineering of mechanical signals required to tailor the growth of
neuronal network morphology. Tackling the complex developmental and
computational processes in the retina requires an interdisciplinary endeavor
combining experiment and theory, physics, and biology. The reward is enticing:
in the next few years, retina organoids could offer a glimpse inside the
machinery of simultaneous cellular self-assembly and signal processing, all in
an in vitro setting.","['q-bio.TO', 'cond-mat.soft']",2022-01-18,2201.07091,10.1063/5.0077014,"['Katja A. Salbaum', 'Elijah R. Shelton', 'Friedhelm Serwane']",2022,1
