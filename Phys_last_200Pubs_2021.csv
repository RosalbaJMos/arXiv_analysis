0,Boltzmann Meets Lorentz: A Surrogate Model for Black Hole Echoes,"The existence of black hole horizons has not been strictly proven
observationally, and indeed it may not be possible to do so. However,
alternatives may be established by the observation of gravitational wave echoes
that probe possible near-horizon structure. These echoes are proposed to be
generated in exotic compact objects that are horizonless and feature a
partially reflecting ""wall"" inside their light rings, creating a cavity in
which gravitational perturbations may echo, while leaking out through the
angular momentum barrier with each pass. The characteristic signature of echoes
is a comb of nearly evenly spaced spectral resonances. While approximately
true, deviations from this simple picture can lead to severe observational
signal losses. In this paper, we explore such subtleties with the latest
results for echo sourcing and geometry. A physically motivated echo model is
then developed as a sum over Lorentzian spectral lines, parametrized by
functions of the horizon frame frequency and the size of the cavity. Our final
spectrum is a function of only the mass and spin of the black hole, as well as
the UV scale of the near-horizon physics. We then apply this model in a search
for echoes in the gravitational wave event with the loudest ringdown signal in
LIGO/Virgo, i.e. GW190521. We interpret our findings as a measurement of the
fractional energy in post-merger echoes equal to $E_{echoes} / E_{GR} = 8.9 \pm
4.5\%$, where the uncertainty range represents the 90% credible region. The
robustness of this result is tested against noise backgrounds and simulated
injections, and we find that a signal persists through modifications to the
model and changes in the data search.","['gr-qc', 'astro-ph.CO', 'astro-ph.HE', 'hep-th']",2021-12-31,"['Randy S. Conklin', 'Niayesh Afshordi']"
1,The Effect of R\'enyi Entropy on Hawking Radiation,"It is widely believed that Hawking radiation originates from excitations near
the horizons of black holes. However, Giddings proposed that the Hawking
radiation spectrum that characterizes evaporating semi-classical black holes
originates from a quantum atmosphere, which extends beyond the horizon of a
black hole. Although several research projects have been conducted in this
field, they have not yet taken into account the effect of R\'enyi entropy. In
the present article, we will therefore consider the effect of R\'enyi entropy
on Hawking radiation power. We assume that if the effect of R\'enyi entropy is
very small, we suggest that the Hawking radiation should originate from the
quantum atmosphere which extends beyond the black hole's horizon for finite
dimensions. That is, that Giddings' suggestion is the more likely of the above
possibilities. However, for infinite dimensions, both suggestions are equally
credible. We briefly consider the very large effect of R\'enyi entropy on
Hawking radiation power as well. We find that if the effect of R\'enyi entropy
is very large and {\omega}/T_{BH} is very small, then the power spectral
density S_R is proportional to the power spectral density S_{BH}.",['hep-th'],2021-12-31,['Yang Liu']
2,"Predicting the Oxidation States of Mn ions in the Oxygen Evolving
  Complex of Photosystem II Using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning","Serial Femtosecond Crystallography at the X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL)
sources enabled the imaging of the catalytic intermediates of the oxygen
evolution reaction of Photosystem II. However, due to the incoherent transition
of the S-states, the resolved structures are a convolution from different
catalytic states. Here, we train Decision Tree Classifier and K-mean clustering
models on Mn compounds obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database to
predict the S-state of the X-ray, XFEL, and CryoEm structures by predicting the
Mn's oxidation states in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). The model agrees
mostly with the XFEL structures in the dark S1 state. However, significant
discrepancies are observed for the excited XFEL states (S2, S3, and S0) and the
dark states of the X-ray and CryoEm structures. Furthermore, there is a
mismatch between the predicted S-states within the two monomers of the same
dimer, mainly in the excited states. The model suggests that improving the
resolution is crucial to precisely resolve the geometry of the illuminated
S-states to overcome the noncoherent S-state transition. In addition,
significant radiation damage is observed in X-ray and CryoEM structures,
particularly at the dangler Mn center (Mn4). Our model represents a valuable
tool for investigating the electronic structure of the catalytic metal cluster
of PSII to understand the water splitting mechanism.","['physics.chem-ph', 'physics.bio-ph']",2021-12-31,['Muhamed Amin']
3,"Band-gap Engineering and Manipulation of the Rashba Spin Splitting in
  Janus van der Waals Heterostructures","The compositional, as well as structural asymmetries in Janus transition
metal dichalcogenides (J-TMDs) and their van der Waals heterostructures (vdW
HSs), induce an intrinsic Rashba spin-splitting. We investigate the variation
of band-gaps and Rashba parameters in three different Janus heterostructures
having AB-stacked MoXY/WXY (X, Y = S, Se, Te; X$\neq$Y) geometry with Y-Y
interface, using first-principles calculations. We consider the effect of
external electric field and in-plane biaxial strain in tuning the strength of
the intrinsic electric field, which leads to remarkable modifications of the
band-gap and the Rashba spin-splitting. In particular, it is found that the
positive applied field and compressive in-plane biaxial strain can lead to a
notable increase in the Rashba spin-splitting of the valence bands about the
$\Gamma$-point. Moreover, our \textit{ab-initio} calculations reveal the
existence of a type-II band alignment in these heterostructures, which remains
robust under positive external field and biaxial strain. These suggest novel
ways of engineering the electronic, optical, and spin properties of J-TMD van
der Waals heterostructures holding a huge promise in spintronic and
optoelectronic devices.","['cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.str-el']",2021-12-31,"['Shubham Patel', 'Urmimala Dey', 'Narayan Prasad Adhikari', 'A. Taraphder']"
4,Spatiotemporal linear instability of viscoelastic slender jets,"We revisit the problem of the two-dimensional spatiotemporal linear stability
of viscoelastic slender jets obeying linear Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) stress
constitutive equation, and investigate the role of finite stresses on the
elasto-capilliary stability of the Beads-on-a-String (BOAS) structure
(structures which include the formation of very thin filament between drops)
and identify the regions of topological transition of the advancing jet
interface, in the limit of low to moderate Ohnesorge number ($Oh$) and high
values of Weissenberg number ($We$). The Briggs idea of analytic continuation
\{previously elucidated in the nonaffine response regime [Bansal, Ghosh and
Sircar, ``Spatiotemporal linear stability of viscoelastic free shear flows:
Nonaffine response regime'', Phys. Fluids {\bf 33}, 054106 (2021)]\} is
deployed to classify regions of temporal stability and absolute and convective
instabilities, as well as evanescent modes, and the results are compared with
previously conducted experiments for viscoelastic filaments. The impact of the
finite stresses are evident in the form of strain-hardening ensuing in lower
absolute growth rates, relatively rapid drainage and finite-time pinch-off. The
phase diagrams reveal the influence of (a) capillary force stabilization at
infinitesimally small values of $Oh$, and (b) inertial stabilization at
significantly larger values of $Oh$.",['physics.flu-dyn'],2021-12-31,"['T. Chauhan', 'D. Bansal', 'S. Sircar']"
5,"Monte Carlo simulations of the electron-gas interactions in the KATRIN
  experiment","At the KATRIN experiment, the electron neutrino mass is inferred from the
shape of the $\beta$-spectrum of tritium. Important systematic effects in the
Windowless Gaseous Tritium Source (WGTS) of the experiment include the energy
loss by electron scattering, and the extended starting potential. In the WGTS,
primary high-energy electrons from $\beta$-decay produce an extended secondary
spectrum of electrons through various atomic and molecular processes including
ionization, recombination, cluster formation and scattering. This electron
spectrum plays a role in understanding electron energy loss processes, but also
for the simulation of plasma processes. These simulations will then provide an
insight on the starting potential. Here, a Monte Carlo approach is used to
model the electron spectrum for a given magnetic and electric field
configuration. The spectrum is evaluated at different positions within the
WGTS, which allows for a direct analysis of the spectrum close to rear wall and
detector end of the experiment. Alongside electrons, also ions are tracked by

6,From Chern-Tenenblat to Jackiw-Teitelboim via sine-Gordon,"The study of 2-dimensional surfaces of constant curvature constitutes a
beautiful branch of geometry with well-documented ties to the mathematical
physics of integrable systems. A lesser known, but equally fascinating, fact is
its connection to 2-dimensional gravity; specifically Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT)
gravity, where the connection manifests through a coordinate choice that
roughly speaking re-casts the gravitational field equations as the sine-Gordon
equation. In this language many well-known results, such as the JT-gravity
black hole and its properties, were understood in terms of sine-Gordon solitons
and their properties. In this brief note, we revisit these ideas in the context
of some of the recent exciting developments in JT-gravity and, more generally,
low-dimensional quantum gravity and speculate on how some of these new ideas
may be similarly understood.","['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']",2021-12-31,['Jeff Murugan']

data collected from the Kepler space telescope, we sequentially re-binned data
three times to investigate the SNR improvement of lower frequency (< 17

solutions in $D = 4$ double field theory. We give the expression of the Hawking

find that for all these limits only Schwarzschild solution and F-JNW solution
can generate Hawking radiation. Moreover, we obtain the lower bound on greybody
factors $\sigma_l(\omega)$ for the spherical solutions in $D = 4$ double field
theory. In particular, we calculate the bound on greybody factors
$\sigma_l(\omega)$ for F-JNW solution. For F-JNW solution, $\sigma_l(\omega)$

9,"Nonclassical correlations in subsystems of globally entangled quantum
  states","The relation between genuine multipartite entanglement in the pure state of a
collection of N qubits and the nonclassical correlations in its two-qubit
subsystems is studied. Quantum discord is used as the quantifier of
nonclassical correlations in the subsystem while the generalised geometric
measure (GGM) [Phys. Rev. A. 81, 012308 (2010)] is used to quantify global
entanglement in the N-qubit state. While no definite discernible dependence
between the two can be found for randomly generated global states, for those
with additional structure like weighted graph states we find that local discord
is indicative of global multipartite entanglement. Global states that admit
efficient classical descriptions like stabilizer states furnish an exception in
which despite multipartite entanglement, nonclassical correlation is absent in
two qubit subsystems. We discuss these results in the context of mixed state
quantum computation where nonclassical correlation is considered a candidate
resource that enables exponential speedup over classical computers.",['quant-ph'],2021-12-31,"['Chandan Mahto', 'Vijay Pathak', 'Ardra K. S.', 'Anil Shaji']"

11,Synchronization of Complex Network Systems with Stochastic Disturbances,"We study the robustness of the synchronization of coupled phase oscillators.
When fluctuations of phase differences in lines caused by disturbance exceed a
certain threshold, the state cannot return to synchrony thus leading to
desynchronization. Our main result is the deviation of explicit formulas of a
variance matrix that characterizes the severity of these fluctuations. We
highlight the utility of these results in two general problems: vulnerable line
identification and network design. We find that the vulnerability of lines can
be encoded by the cycle space of graphs. It is analytically shown that a line
in large-size cycles is more vulnerable than those in small-size cycles and
adding a new line or increasing coupling strength of a line reduces the
vulnerability of the lines in any cycle including this line, while it does not
affect the vulnerability of the other lines.","['nlin.AO', 'cs.SY', 'eess.SY']",2021-12-31,"['Kaihua Xi', 'Zhen Wang', 'Aijie Cheng', 'Hai Xiang Lin', 'Jan H. van Schuppen', 'Chenghui Zhang']"
12,"Modelling the behavior of human crowds with interacting particle systems
  in active-passive population dynamics","The modelling of human crowd behaviors offers many challenging questions to
science in general. Specifically, the social human behavior consists of many
physiological and psychological processes which are still largely unknown. To
model reliably such human crowd systems with complex social interactions,
stochastic tools play an important role for the setting of mathematical
formulations of the problems. In this work, using the description based on an
exclusion principle, we study a statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model
for active-passive population dynamics with an application to human crowd
behaviors. We provide representative numerical examples for the evacuation
dynamics of human crowds, where the main focus in our considerations is given
to an interacting particle system of active and passive human groups.
Furthermore, our numerical results show that the communication between active
and passive humans strongly influences the evacuation time of the whole
population even when the ""faster-is-slower"" phenomenon is taken into account.
Finally, to provide an additional inside into the problem, a stationary state
of our model is analyzed via current representations and heat map techniques.",['physics.soc-ph'],2021-12-31,"['Thi Kim Thoa Thieu', 'Roderick Melnik']"
13,"Entering voltage hysteresis in phase separating materials: revealing the
  thermodynamic origin of a newly discovered phenomenon and its impact on the
  electric response of a battery","Hysteresis is a general phenomenon regularly observed in measurements of
various materials properties such as magnetism, elasticity, capillary pressure,
adsorption, battery voltage etc. Usually, the hysteretic behaviour is an
intrinsic property that cannot be avoided or circumvented in dynamic operation
of the system. Here we show, however, that at least as regards the hysteretic
behaviour of phase-separating battery materials, one can enter (deeply) into
the hysteretic loop in specific, yet realistic, transient operating conditions.
Within the hysteretic loop a (significant) portion of particle population
resides in an intraparticle phase separated state. Interestingly, the
transition to the more conventional interparticle phase separation state found
outside the hysteretic loop is very slow. Further, we establish a direct
interrelation between the intraparticle phase separated electrode state and
altered electric response of the electrode, which significantly impacts DC and
AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence of entering the
hysteretic loop and the resulting altered response of the battery are explained
based on thermodynamic reasoning, advanced modelling and insightful
experiments. We believe that the understanding of this phenomenon will help
optimise the diagnostics and monitoring of batteries, while also providing
pertinent motivation for the enhancement of battery design and performance.","['cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.soft', 'physics.chem-ph']",2021-12-31,"['Tomaz Katrasnik', 'Joze Moskon', 'Klemen Zelic', 'Igor Mele', 'Francisco Ruiz-Zepeda', 'Miran Gaberscek']"

15,Radon Emanation from Dust of Varying Composition and Size,"$^{222}Rn$ emanating from environmental dust constitutes an important
background component for many low-energy, low-rate experiments. Radon emanation
rates from dust and rock, thus, are important for experiment planning. In this
paper, we report measured radon emanation fractions (defined here as the ratio
of the transient to the total radon progeny activity of a sample) for five
types of dust differing in grain size and composition. This data was obtained
using high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe), measuring emanated and
non-emanated $^{222}Rn$ progeny activities and their temporal change. The range
of observed radon emanation fractions ranges from $3.5 \pm 1.9\%$ and $16.1 \pm
0.84\%$. The impact of the water, contained in the dust, might have on the
emanation fraction was evaluated and found to be small. The data presented here
do not show a clear correlation between dust particle size and emanation
fraction, as hypothesized when starting this study. Our measurement results are

fields on Weyl equivalent spaces in $d=4$ dimension. We express the partition
function of Weyl graviton and conformal higher spin fields as an integral over
characters on $S^1\times AdS_3$, $S^4$, and $AdS_4$. We observe that the
partition function of conformal higher spins on hyperbolic cylinders differs
from the partition function on $S^4$ by the `edge' contribution. The
logarithmic coefficient obtained from the character integral of the partition
function of conformal higher spins on $AdS_4$ is the half of that obtained from
the partition function on $S^4$. We evaluate the entanglement entropy and the
conformal dimension of the twist operator from the partition function on the
hyperbolic cylinder. The conformal dimension of the co-dimension two twist
operator enables us to find a linear relation between Hofman-Maldacena
variables which we use to show the non-unitarity of the theory. We observe that
the spectrum of the quasinormal modes of conformal higher spins obtained from

the secondary spectra of HR for energy below 5\,GeV, ii) the contributions to
the measured isotropic flux from the Galactic PBH HR and that from annihilation
radiation due to evaporated positrons, iii) inclusion of astrophysical
background from gamma-ray sources. The conservative constraint is significantly
improved by more than an order of magnitude at $2\times10^{16}$g$\lesssim

18,"Non-local triple quantum dot thermometer based on Coulomb-coupled
  systems","Recent proposals towards non-local thermoelectric voltage-based thermometry,
in the conventional dual quantum dot set-up, demand an asymmetric step-like
system-to-reservoir coupling around the ground states for optimal operation
(Physica E, 114, 113635, 2019). In addition to such demand for unrealistic
coupling, the sensitivity in such a strategy also depends on the average
measurement terminal temperature, which may result in erroneous temperature
assessment. In this paper, I propose non-local current based thermometry in the
dual dot set-up as a practical alternative and demonstrate that in the regime
of high bias, the sensitivity remains robust against fluctuations of the
measurement terminal temperature. Proceeding further, I propose a non-local
triple quantum dot thermometer, that provides an enhanced sensitivity while
bypassing the demand for unrealistic step-like system-to-reservoir coupling and
being robust against fabrication induced variability in Coulomb coupling. In
addition, I show that the heat extracted from (to) the target reservoir, in the
triple dot design, can also be suppressed drastically by appropriate
fabrication strategy, to prevent thermometry induced drift in reservoir
temperature. The proposed triple dot setup thus offers a multitude of benefits
and could potentially pave the path towards the practical realization and
deployment of high-performance non-local ``sub-Kelvin range"" thermometers.","['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'physics.app-ph']",2021-12-31,['Aniket Singha']

with a quantum resource. In this article we study the problem of revocation of
quantum secret shared by the dealer with two shareholders in a three party
scenario. In the existing secret sharing protocols there are no means by which
the dealer can retrieve back the secret once he/she finds all the share holders
to be dishonest. Our protocol makes a significant advancement in solving this
problem by designing strategy in bringing back the secret in the worst possible
situation when all the shareholders/receivers are dishonest . In our proposed
strategy the dealer also possesses a quantum share of the secret which empowers
the dealer to bring back the secret even after sharing is done. However the
protocol along with the revocation process also ensures the normal
reconstruction at the share holder's location when they are honest. This
advantage comes with the expense of extra one qubit on dealer's side and
consequently we require a four qubit resource to start with for 1-dealer and
2-share holder's scenario. Here in this article we not only give the
description of our protocol but also give an example where our protocol is

27,Vertex-based Diagrammatic Treatment of Light-Matter-Coupled Systems,"We propose a diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach for general spin-boson models,
which can be regarded as a generalization of the strong-coupling expansion for
fermionic impurity models. The algorithm is based on a self-consistently
computed three-point vertex and a stochastically sampled four-point vertex, and
achieves convergence to the numerically exact result in a wide parameter
regime. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated with applications to a
spin-boson model representing an emitter in a waveguide. As a function of the
coupling strength, the spin exhibits a delocalization-localization crossover at
low temperatures, signaling a qualitative change in the real-time relaxation.
In certain parameter regimes, the response functions of the emitter coupled to
the electromagnetic continuum can be described by an effective Rabi model with
appropriately defined parameters. We also discuss the spatial distribution of
the photon density around the emitter.",['cond-mat.str-el'],2021-12-31,"['Aaram J. Kim', 'Katharina Lenk', 'Jiajun Li', 'Philipp Werner', 'Martin Eckstein']"

function of hydrostatic pressure and uniaxial strain in two types of
superlattices: HgTe/CdTe and HgTe/HgSe. In short-period HgTe/CdTe
superlattices, our analysis unveils the presence of isoenergetic nodal lines,
which could host strain-induced three-dimensional flat bands at the Fermi level
without requiring doping, when fabricated, for instance, as core-shell
nanowires. In contrast, HgTe/HgSe short-period superlattices are found to
harbor a rich phase diagram with a plethora of topological phases. Notably, the
unstrained superlattice realizes an ideal Weyl semimetal with Weyl points
situated at the Fermi level. A small-gap topological insulator with multiple
band inversions can be obtained by tuning the volume: under compressive
uniaxial strain, the material transitions sequentially into a Dirac semimetal
to a nodal-line semimetal, and finally into a topological insulator with a
single band inversion.","['cond-mat.mtrl-sci', 'cond-mat.mes-hall']",2021-12-31,"['Rajibul Islam', 'Barun Ghosh', 'Giuseppe Cuono', 'Alexander Lau', 'Wojciech Brzezicki', 'Arun Bansil', 'Amit Agarwal', 'Bahadur Singh', 'Tomasz Dietl', 'Carmine Autieri']"

detected with only one detection in extragalactic environments, namely along
two sight lines in the red shift z=0.89 absorber towards the lensed blazar PKS

which were initially ionised by cosmic rays and molecular hydrogen, ArH+ has
been shown to be an excellent tracer of atomic gas as well as the impinging
cosmic-ray ionisation rates. In this work, we attempt to extend the
observations of ArH+in extragalactic sources to examine its use as a tracer of
the atomic interstellar medium (ISM) in these galaxies. We report the detection
of ArH+ towards two luminous nearby galaxies, NGC 253 and NGC 4945, and the
non-detection towards Arp 220 observed using the SEPIA660 receiver on the APEX

observe the NKaKc=1_1,0-1_0,1 transitions of another atomic gas tracer p-H2O+
at 607.227 GHz with the ArH+ line, simultaneously. We modelled the optically
thin spectra of both species and compared their observed line profiles with
that of other well-known atomic gas tracers such as OH+ and o-H2O+ and diffuse
and dense molecular gas tracers HF and CO, respectively. By further assuming
that the observed absorption from the ArH+, OH+, and H2O+ molecules are

approach for computing optimal protocols based on automatic differentiation.
Our methodology is applicable to complex systems and multidimensional protocols

reproducing theoretical optimal protocols for a Brownian particle in a
time-varying harmonic trap. We also compute departures from near-equilibrium
behaviour for magnetization reversal on an Ising lattice and for barrier
crossing driven by a harmonic trap, which has been used to represent a range of
biological processes including biomolecular unfolding reactions. Algorithms
based on automatic differentiation outperform the near-equilibrium theory for
far-from-equilibrium magnetization reversal and driven barrier crossing. The
optimal protocol for crossing an energy landscape barrier of 10kT is found to
hasten the approach to, and slow the departure from, the barrier region

Discontinuities in material properties (e.g., effective-mass, electron

Self-Consistent effective-mass approach to study quantum electronic devices

density of the metallic atoms is much higher than that of the nitride atoms,

fascinating electronic and optical properties. The optical band gap is varied

be for the foreseeable future. Despite their extensive use, turbulent
combustion of large hydrocarbon fuels, remains relatively poorly understood and
difficult to predict. A key parameter when burning these fuels is the turbulent
consumption speed; the velocity at which fuel and air are consumed through a
turbulent flame front. Such information can be useful as a model input
parameter and for validation of modeled results. In this study, turbulent
consumption speeds were measured for three jet-like fuels using a premixed
turbulent Bunsen burner. The burner was used to independently control
turbulence intensity, unburned temperature, and equivalence ratio. Each fuel
had similar heat releases (within 2%), laminar flame speeds (within 5-15 %),
and adiabatic flame temperatures. Despite this similarity, for constant Re_D
and turbulence intensity, A2 (i.e., jet-A) has the highest turbulent flame
speeds and remains stable (i.e., without tip quenching) at lower {\phi} than
the other fuels evaluated. In contrast the C1 fuel, which contains no
aromatics, has the slowest turbulent flame speeds and exhibits tip quenching at
higher {\phi} then the other fuels. C1 was the most sensitive to the influence
of turbulence, as evidenced by this fuel having the largest ratio of turbulent
to laminar flame speeds. The C1 fuel had the highest stretch sensitivity, in
general, as indicated by calculated Markstein numbers. This work shows that
turbulent flame speeds and tip stability of multi-component large hydrocarbon
fuels can be sensitive to the chemical class of its components. The results
from the current work indicate that caution may be needed when using
alternative or surrogate fuels to replicate conventional fuels, especially if
the alternative fuels are missing chemical classes of fuels that influence

in the Strohual number-separation distance phase maps, which include separated
wake, merged wake, and transitional-merged wake. Furthermore, a novel model is
introduced based on fundamental flow variables including velocity, location,
and circulation of dipole structures to quantitatively distinguish vortex
patterns in the wake. The physical mechanism of wake merging process is also
elucidated. When an oscillating foil experiences the jet deflection phenomenon,
secondary structures shed from the primary street traverse in the other
direction by making an angle with its parent vortex street. For parallel foils,
secondary structures from the vortex street of the lower foil interact with the
primary vortex street of the upper foil under certain kinematic conditions.
This interaction triggers the wake merging process by influencing circulation
of coherent structures in the upper part of the wake. It is unveiled that
merging of the wakes leads to enhancements in propulsive efficiency by
increasing thrust generation without a significant alteration in power
requirements. These are attributed to the formation of a high-momentum jet by
the merged vortex street, which possesses significantly larger circulation due
to the amalgamation of the vortices, and major alterations in the evolution of
leading edge vortices. Thus, flow physics that are thoroughly explored here are

torques between interior regions, and viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling
at the boundaries of the fluid core. We show that the coupling between
Mercury's interior regions is sufficiently strong that the obliquity of the
mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01
arcmin. The mantle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the
change between a large and no inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM
coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the inner core boundary and, if
the core magnetic field strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the fluid and solid
cores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational
coupling between the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the
more this co-precessing core is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and
the more the obliquity of the polar moment of inertia approaches that expected
for a rigid planet. The misalignment between the polar moment of inertia and
mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007
arcmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis

impressive tools such as SIM, PALM/STORM, and STED microscopy. How to combat
this challenge ideally has been an open question for decades. Inspired by a

GW190521 is in a class of its own. The exceptionally loud ringdown of this
merger makes it an ideal candidate to search for gravitational wave echoes, a
proposed smoking gun for the quantum structure of black hole horizons. We
perform an unprecedented multi-pronged search for echoes via two
well-established and independent pipelines: a template-based search for
stimulated emission of Hawking radiation, or Boltzmann echoes, and the
model-agnostic coherent WaveBurst (cWB) search. Stimulated Hawking radiation
from the merger is expected to lead to post-merger echoes at horizon mode
frequency of $\sim 50$ Hz (for quadrupolar gravitational radiation), repeating
at intervals of $\sim 1$ second, due to partial reflection off Planckian
quantum structure of the horizon. A careful analysis using dynamic nested
sampling yields a Bayesian evidence of $ 7\pm 2$ (90% confidence level) for
this signal following GW190521, carrying an excess of $10^{+9}_{-7}\%$ in
gravitational wave energy, relative to the main event. Similarly, the
reconstructed waveform of the first echo in cWB carries an energy excess of
$13^{+16}_{-7}\%$. Accounting for the ""look-elsewhere"" effects, we estimate a
p-value for false detection probability of $5.1 \times 10^{-3}$ (or
2.6$\sigma$) using cWB pipeline, although the verdict on the co-localization of
the post-merger echo and the main event in the sky is inconclusive. While the
current evidence for stimulated Hawking radiation does not reach the gold
standard of $5\sigma$, our findings are in line with expectations for
stimulated Hawking radiation at current detector sensitivities. The next
generation of gravitational wave observatories can thus draw a definitive

50,Capture of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars,"The extreme conditions in Neutron Stars make them ideal test facilities for
fundamental interactions. A Neutron Star can capture Dark Matter via
scattering. As a result of the scattering, Dark Matter kinetic energy is
transferred to the star. An observational consequence of this can be the
warming of old neutron stars to near-infrared temperatures. Different
approximations or simplifications have been applied to previous analyses of the
capture process. In this article, we summarise a significantly improved
treatment of Dark Matter capture, which properly accounts for all relevant
physical effects over a wide range of Dark Matter masses. Among them are
gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli
blocking, neutron star opacity and multiple scattering effects. This paper
cites general expressions that allow the capture rate to be computed
numerically, and simplified expressions for particular types of interactions or
mass regimes, which greatly increase the efficiency of computation. As a result

  metastable states in the one-dimensional extended Peierls-Hubbard model","We investigate the microscopic dynamics at the initial stage of photoinduced
phase transitions in tetrathiafulvalene-$p$-chloranil by exact diagonalization.
We first show that the one-dimensional extended Peierls-Hubbard model exhibits
a neutral phase with small ionicity and negligible dimerization and an ionic
phase with moderate ionicity and dimerization. Besides these phases, we find a
doubly-ionized phase with strong dimerization that we call the ""dipole"" phase.
These ground state phases are characterized by various order parameters and the
Zak phase, which is relevant to electronic polarization. We further explore the
microscopic dynamics of the three phases triggered by short monocycle optical
pulses. The electronic order parameters and lattice displacement suggest that
the neutral-ionic, ionic-neutral, and dipole-ionic transitions are induced.
Furthermore, clear spectroscopic changes are observed in the time-dependent
spectral density and pump-probe conductivity. A detailed analysis of the

complex part and assuming the real part of the quintessence field to be a

describe the real universe since this will lead to fractional energy density
\Omega_D > 1, where \Omega_D can be defined as the ratio of \rho_D to
\rho_{cr}. However, for the interacting case, if we take present \Omega_D =
0.73, then we can determine that b^2 = 0.0849, where b^2 is the interaction
coupling parameter between matter and dark energy. In the real quintessence

Among his numerous achievements is the assignment of sensible, finite values to
divergent series, which correspond to Riemann's $\zeta$-function with negative
integer arguments. He hardly left any explanation about it, but following the
few hints that he gave, we construct a direct justification for the best known
example, based on analytic continuation. As a physical application of Ramanujan
summation we discuss the Casimir effect, where this way of removing a divergent
term corresponds to the renormalization of the vacuum energy density, in
particular of the photon field. This leads to the prediction of the Casimir
force between conducting plates, which has now been accurately confirmed by
experiments. Finally we review the discussion about the meaning and

electrons in the heliosphere. We derive a gyro-averaged kinetic transport
equation that accounts for the spherical expansion of the solar wind and the
geometry of the Parker-spiral magnetic field. To solve our three-dimensional
kinetic equation, we develop a mathematical approach that combines the
Crank--Nicolson scheme in velocity space and a finite-difference Euler scheme
in configuration space. We initialize our model with isotropic electron
distribution functions and calculate the kinetic expansion at heliocentric
distances from 5 to 20 solar radii. In our kinetic model, the electrons evolve
mainly through the combination of the ballistic particle streaming, the
magnetic mirror force, and the electric field. By applying fits to our
numerical results, we quantify the parameters of the electron strahl and core
part of the electron velocity distributions. The strahl fit parameters show
that the density of the electron strahl is around 7% of the total electron
density at a distance of 20 solar radii, the strahl bulk velocity and strahl
temperature parallel to the background magnetic field stay approximately
constant beyond a distance of 15 solar radii, and $\beta_{\parallel s}$ (i.e.,
the ratio between strahl parallel thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure) is
approximately constant with heliocentric distance at a value of about 0.02. We
compare our results with data measured by Parker Solar Probe. Furthermore, we

problem that has impacted different aspects of our lives, including politics

that automates the detection of fake news. Natural human behavior is to
cross-check new information with reliable sources. We use Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and build a machine learning (ML) model that automates the
process of cross-checking new information with a set of predefined reliable
sources. We implement this for Twitter and build a model that flags fake
tweets. Specifically, for a given tweet, we use its text to find relevant news
from reliable news agencies. We then train a Random Forest model that checks if
the textual content of the tweet is aligned with the trusted news. If it is
not, the tweet is classified as fake. This approach can be generally applied to
any kind of information and is not limited to a specific news story or a
category of information. Our implementation of this approach gives a $70\%$
accuracy which outperforms other generic fake-news classification models. These
results pave the way towards a more sensible and natural approach to fake news

locally irreducible in every bipartition, which shows the phenomenon of strong
quantum nonlocality without entanglement. It is known that unextendible product
bases (UPBs) can show the phenomenon of quantum nonlocality without
entanglement. Thus it is interesting to investigate the strong quantum
nonlocality for UPBs. Most of the UPBs with the minimum size cannot demonstrate
strong quantum nonlocality. In this paper, we construct a series of UPBs with
different large sizes in $d_A\otimes d_B\otimes d_C$ and $d_A\otimes d_B\otimes
d_C\otimes d_D$ for $d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D\geq 3$, and we also show that these

that bulk amorphous palladium becomes magnetic; so, naturally one should ask,
could defective palladium develop magnetism? In particular, would amorphous
porous palladium become magnetic? Here we show that the answer to that question

that depends on the amount of sample porosity and on the topology of their

$10$ K. We provided an explanation as to why \textit{a}-Bi superconducts and
the crystalline (\textit{c}-Bi) had not been found to do so: we computer
calculated their electronic properties and found that \textit{a}-Bi has a
larger electron density of states, eDoS, at the Fermi surface than
\textit{c}-Bi and this explained the phenomenon. We even predicted an upper
limit for the superconducting $T_c$ of the crystalline phase, which was
experimentally corroborated within the following year. We now decided to
investigate what happens to crystalline (Wyckoff structure) and amorphous Bi
when pressures below the atmospheric are applied (expansion). Here we show that
when expanded, \textit{c}-Bi becomes more metallic, since the eDoS increases
when the volume increases for the Wyckoff structure, while the amorphous eDoS
decreases. If the crystalline structure is maintained its $T_c$ would rise
under expansion, whereas it would diminish for the \textit{a}-Bi. Expansion can
be obtained in the laboratory by chemically etching Bi-based alloys, a process

exact analytical solutions. We show how new models can be constructed through
generalisations of some well known nonlinear partial differential equations
with PT-symmetries whilst preserving integrability. Subsequently, we develop
new methods from well-known ones to obtain exact analytical soliton solutions
for these new systems. The first PT-symmetric generalization we take are
extensions to the complex and multicomplex fields. In agreement with the
reality property present in PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum systems, we find
PT-symmetries also play a key role in the reality of conserved charges here. We
then extend our investigations to explore degenerate multi-soliton solutions
for the sine-Gordon and Hirota equations. In particular, we find the usual
time-delays from degenerate soliton solution scattering are time-dependent,
unlike the non-degenerate multi-soliton solutions, and provide a universal
formula to compute the exact time-delay values for the scattering of N-soliton
solutions. Other PT-symmetric extensions of integrable systems we take are of
nonlocal nature, with nonlocalities in space and/or in time, of time crystal
type. Whilst developing new methods for the construction of soliton solutions
for these systems, we find new types of solutions with different parameter
dependence and qualitative behaviour even in the one-soliton solution cases. We
exploit gauge equivalence between the Hirota system with continuous Heisenberg
and Landau-Lifschitz systems to see how nonlocality is inherited from one
system to another and vice versa. Extending investigations to the quantum
regime, we generalize the scheme of Darboux transformations for fully
time-dependent non-Hermitian quantum systems, which allows us to create an

construct a fermion bag algorithm to study this phase transition and find
evidence for it to be second order. Numerical study shows that the universality

  Quantum Computer","Quantum computers have an exponential speed-up advantage over classical
computers. One of the most prominent utilities of quantum computers is their
ability to study complex quantum systems in various fields using quantum
computational algorithms. Quantum computational algorithms can be used to study
cosmological systems and how they behave with variations in the different
parameters of the system. Here, we use the variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE) algorithm to simulate the Hawking radiation phenomenon. VQE algorithm is
a combination of quantum and classical computation methods used to obtain the
minimum energy eigenvalue for a given Hamiltonian. Three different custom
ansatzes are used in the VQE algorithm from which the results for the case with
minimum errors are studied. We obtain the plots for temperature and power from
the minimum energy eigenvalue recorded for different values of mass and
distance from the center of the black hole. The final result is then analyzed

  fabrication methods","Light trapping photonic crystal (PhC) patterns on the surface of Si solar
cells provides a novel opportunity to approach the theoretical efficiency limit
of 32.3%, for light-to-electrical power conversion with a single junction cell.
This is beyond the efficiency limit implied by the Lambertian limit of ray
trapping 29%. The interference and slow light effects are harnessed for
collecting light even at the long wavelengths near the Si band-gap. We compare
two different methods for surface patterning, that can be extended to large
area surface patterning: 1) laser direct write and 2) step-&-repeat 5-times
reduction projection lithography. Large area throughput limitations of these
methods are compared with the established electron beam lithography (EBL)
route, which is conventionally utilised but much slower than the presented
methods. Spectral characterisation of the PhC light trapping is compared for
samples fabricated by different methods. Reflectance of Si etched via laser
patterned mask was 7% at visible wavelengths and was comparable with Si
patterned via EBL made mask. The later pattern showed a stronger absorbance
than the Lambertian limit (M.-L. Hsieh et al., Sci.

first-order, thermal phase transitions. These are usually assumed to proceed
via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase.
However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe
may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal
region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of
unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase
domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in
a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational
wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble
nucleation. We discuss the possibility that the spinodal dynamics may be
preceded by a period of thermal inflation.","['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'hep-ph']",2021-12-31,"['Yago Bea', 'Jorge Casalderrey-Solana', 'Thanasis Giannakopoulos', 'Aron Jansen', 'Sven Krippendorf', 'David Mateos', 'Mikel Sanchez-Garitaonandia', 'Miguel Zilhão']"

cavity noise by a factor of 20-30. The second order Doppler shift causes a
shift in the lasing frequency on the order of 500 Hz. For the cold atom beam we
find that the output power is on the order of hundreds of pW, however the

80,"Contemporary formation of early solar system planetesimals at two
  distinct radial locations","The formation of planetesimals is expected to occur via particle-gas
instabilities that concentrate dust into self-gravitating clumps. Triggering
these instabilities requires the prior pileup of dust in the protoplanetary
disk. Until now, this has been successfully modeled exclusively at the disk's
snowline, whereas rocky planetesimals in the inner disk were obtained only by
assuming either unrealistically large particle sizes or an enhanced global disk
metallicity. However, planetesimal formation solely at the snowline is
difficult to reconcile with the early and contemporaneous formation of iron
meteorite parent bodies with distinct oxidation states and isotopic
compositions, indicating formation at different radial locations in the disk.
Here, by modeling the evolution of a disk with ongoing accretion of material
from the collapsing molecular cloud, we show that planetesimal formation may
have been triggered within the first 0.5 million years by dust pileup at both
the snowline (at approximately 5 au) and the silicate sublimation line (at
approximately 1 au), provided turbulent diffusion was low. Particle
concentration at approximately 1 au is due to the early outward radial motion
of gas and is assisted by the sublimation and recondensation of silicates. Our
results indicate that, although the planetesimals at the two locations formed
about contemporaneously, those at the snowline accreted a large fraction of
their mass (approximately 60 percent) from materials delivered to the disk in
the first few 10,000 yr, whereas this fraction is only 30 percent for the
planetesimals formed at the silicate line. Thus, provided that the isotopic
composition of the delivered material changed with time, these two planetesimal
populations should have distinct isotopic compositions, consistent with
observations.",['astro-ph.EP'],2021-12-31,"['Alessandro Morbidelli', 'Kevin Baillie', 'Konstantin Batygin', 'Sebastien Charnoz', 'Tristan Guillot', 'David C. Rubie', 'Thorsten Kleine']"

the progression rate of the cancer cells or the healing time of the wound. In

quantification of the degree of activity from the collective, long-range phonon
response in the system. We find that the four-point dynamic susceptibility,
$\chi_4(t)$ at the phonon timescale, grows with increased activity. We then
show how one can estimate the degree of the activity at such a small timescale
by measuring the growth of $\chi_4(t)$ with changing activity. A detailed
finite size analysis of this measurement, shows that the peak height of
$\chi_4(t)$ at this phonon timescale increases strongly with increasing system
size suggesting a possible existence of an intrinsic dynamic length scale that
grows with increasing activity. Finally, we show that this peak height is a
unique function of effective activity across all system sizes, serving as a
possible parameter for characterizing the degree of activity in a system.","['cond-mat.soft', 'cond-mat.dis-nn']",2021-12-31,"['Subhodeep Dey', 'Anoop Mutneja', 'Smarajit Karmakar']"

for long. Herwig et al. showed, that the cause is a diffusive shear work
exchange. Based on their work, a new junction internal model is described,
while the conventional head loss is named external. The latter is obtained
experimentally, while the first cannot. This fact seems to push back reaching a
practical solution. Conventionally two head `loss' coefficients are required.
However the internal model needs three: two `pure' head loss coefficients and a
work coefficient. Based on previous works, the paper shows that the missing
equation comes from the Minimum Energy Dissipation Principle (MinEDP). The
characteristic differential equation of a T-junction is discovered, which
relates the two `pure' head loss coefficients. A particular case is presented
to illustrate how to obtain the internal model from the external one by using
it. The results are applied to empirical and numerical data from the same

secondly, how to evaluate a highly oscillatory path integral over unbounded
domains. Relying on Picard-Lefschetz theory to address the second question for
discrete Regge gravity, we will illustrate that it can also answer the first
question. To this end we will define the Regge action for complexified
variables and study its analytical continuation. Although there have been
previously two different versions defined for the Lorentzian Regge action, we

only if they were residing in FOF haloes, and assigned them to the same

declining as a function of redshift, reference halo mass and particle type. Our
results confirm other indications in the literature of a ""mesoscopic""
constraint, operating at a collective level in the energy space, extending now

curve when a mechanical loading is applied in alternating directions. This
effect, also known as the Bauschinger effect, is intimately related to the
reversibile part of the plastic deformation and controls the materials damage
and ultimately their failure. In the present work, we associate mesoscale
Dislocation Dynamics simulations and Finite Element simulations to identify two
original dislocation mechanisms at the origin of the traction/compression
asymmetry and quantify their impacts on the cyclic behaviour of FCC
single-crystals. After demonstrating that no long-range internal stresses can
be measured in the simulations, careful analysis of the dislocation network
show that the Bauschinger effect is caused by an asymmetry in the stability of
junctions formed from segments whose curvature is determined by the applied
stress, and a significant portion of the stored dislocation segments is easily
recovered during the backward motion of dislocations in previously explored
regions of the crystal. These mechanisms are incorporated into a modified
crystal plasticity framework with few parameters quantified from statistical
analysis of Dislocation Dynamics simulations or from the literature. This
strategy has a real predictive capability and the macroscale results are in

relative purity factors of charger and battery spins. By experimentally
measuring the polarization of the battery spin undergoing charging, we estimate
the battery energy and establish the theoretically predicted quantum advantage.
We propose using the quantum advantage, which depends on the entanglement among
chargers and battery, as a measure for estimating the size of the entangled
cluster. We develop a simple iterative method to realize asymptotic charging
avoiding oscillatory behaviour of charging and discharging. Finally, we
introduce a load spin and realize a charger-battery-load circuit and
experimentally demonstrate battery energy consumption after varying durations
of battery storage, for up to two minutes.",['quant-ph'],2021-12-31,"['Jitendra Joshi', 'T S Mahesh']"
100,Approach to $K\to \ell\nu_\ell \ell'^+ \ell'^-$ decay width on lattice,"Lattice QCD plays an increasing role in reducing theoretical uncertainties in
kaon decays. Here we focus on kaon decay channels $K\to \ell\nu_\ell \ell'^+
\ell'^-$, which are closely related to radiative kaon decays since the lepton
pairs $\ell'^+ \ell'^-$ come from virtual photon emission: $K\to \ell\nu_\ell
\gamma^* \to \ell\nu_\ell \ell'^+ \ell'^-$. Compared with real photon emission,
these channels involve more complicated form factors due to the off-shell
photon with possible large momentum transfer, which causes a challenge to
lattice-QCD studies. In this work, we introduce a lattice calculation procedure
for their decay width, which can avoid parameterization of form factors. The
systematic errors in our method are found to be controllable. Infinite volume
reconstruction method is adopted to remove the temporal truncation effects and
reduce finite volume effects from kaon intermediate state. This approach sets
up a bridge between lattice QCD calculation and experimental measurement of
decay width.",['hep-lat'],2021-12-31,['Xin-Yu Tuo']

these charges on the gravity phase space. The truncation of this action to
quadratic order and the associated charge conservation laws yield an infinite
tower of soft theorems. We show that the canonical action of the higher spin

by large density perturbations that collapse during a stiff fluid domination
phase. Such a phase can be realized by a runaway-inflaton model that crosses an
inflection point or a sharp feature at the last stage of inflation. Mini PBHs
evaporate promptly and reheat the early universe. In addition, we examine two
notable implications of this scenario: the possible presence of PBH evaporation
remnants in galaxies and a non-zero residual potential energy density for the
runaway inflaton that might play the role of the dark energy. We specify the
parameter space that this scenario can be realized and we find that a transit
PBH domination phase is necessary due to gravitational wave (GW) constraints. A
distinct prediction of the scenario is a compound GW signal that might be
probed by current and future experiments. We also demonstrate our results

  Presence of External Electromagnetic Fields","Ideal Chern insulating phases arise in two-dimensional systems with broken
time-reversal symmetry. They are characterized by having nearly-flat bands, and
a uniform quantum geometry -- which combines the Berry curvature and quantum
metric -- and by being incompressible. In this work, we analyze the role of the
quantum geometry in ideal Chern insulators aiming to describe transport in
presence of external out-of-plane magnetic and electric fields. We firstly show
that in the absence of external perturbations, novel Berry connections appear
in ideal Chern insulating phases. Secondly, we provide a detailed analysis of
the deformation of the quantum geometry once weak out-of-plane magnetic fields
are switched on. The perturbed Berry curvature and quantum metric provide an
effective quantum geometry, which is analyzed in the insulating regime and
provides an application of our novel connections. The conditions under which
the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra is realized in this situation are
discussed. Furthermore, an investigation of electrical transport due to the new
effective quantum geometry is presented once an electric field is added.
Restricting to the case of two bands in the metallic regime the quantum metric
appears as measurable quantum mechanical correction in the Hall response. Our
findings can be applied, for instance, to rhombohedral trilayer graphene at low
energies.","['cond-mat.mes-hall', 'cond-mat.str-el']",2021-12-31,"['Christian Northe', 'Giandomenico Palumbo', 'Jonathan Sturm', 'Christian Tutschku', 'Ewelina M. Hankiewicz']"
104,On thermodynamics of compact objects,"With the recent progress in observations of astrophysical black holes, it has
become more important to understand in detail the physics of strongly
gravitating horizonless objects. If the objects identified in the observations
are indeed horizonless and ultracompact, high curvature effects may come into
play, and their explorations may be intimately related to new physics beyond
General Relativity (GR). In this paper, we revisit the concept of statistical
thermodynamics in curved spacetime, focusing on self-gravitating compact
systems without event horizons. Differently from the previous studies in this
context, we develop a generic framework with no explicit dependence on the
gravitational field equations, which is then applicable to a general theory of
gravity. Defining the global variables directly from the local counterparts,
the conventional thermodynamics follows for a generic curved spacetime. The key
step is the appropriate identification of thermodynamic volume to ensure the
first law of thermodynamics, which is in general different from the geometric
volume. For demonstration, we consider familiar examples of self-gravitating
gas in GR, where the connection to previous studies becomes clear. We also
discuss 2-2-holes in quadratic gravity, a novel example of black hole mimickers
that features super-Planckian curvatures in the interior. When the physical
mass is treated as the total internal energy, interesting connections to black
hole thermodynamics emerge. We find universal high curvature effects in
thermodynamics for these objects, and the dominant effects happen to be
conveniently encoded in the thermodynamic volume.","['gr-qc', 'hep-th']",2021-12-31,"['Ufuk Aydemir', 'Jing Ren']"
105,"Machine Learning Trivializing Maps: A First Step Towards Understanding
  How Flow-Based Samplers Scale Up","A trivializing map is a field transformation whose Jacobian determinant
exactly cancels the interaction terms in the action, providing a representation
of the theory in terms of a deterministic transformation of a distribution from
which sampling is trivial. Recently, a proof-of-principle study by Albergo,
Kanwar and Shanahan [arXiv:1904.12072] demonstrated that approximations of
trivializing maps can be `machine-learned' by a class of invertible,
differentiable neural models called \textit{normalizing flows}. By ensuring
that the Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently, asymptotically exact
sampling from the theory of interest can be performed by drawing samples from a
simple distribution and passing them through the network. From a theoretical
perspective, this approach has the potential to become more efficient than
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, where
autocorrelations severely diminish the sampling efficiency as one approaches
the continuum limit. A major caveat is that it is not yet understood how the
size of models and the cost of training them is expected to scale. As a first
step, we have conducted an exploratory scaling study using two-dimensional
$\phi^4$ with up to $20^2$ lattice sites. Although the scope of our study is
limited to a particular model architecture and training algorithm, initial
results paint an interesting picture in which training costs grow very quickly
indeed. We describe a candidate explanation for the poor scaling, and outline
our intentions to clarify the situation in future work.","['hep-lat', 'cs.LG']",2021-12-31,"['Luigi Del Debbio', 'Joe Marsh Rossney', 'Michael Wilson']"

to the local spin polarization, we consider the helicity polarization beyond
global equilibrium and investigate the contributions induced by thermal
vorticity, shear viscous tensor, and the fluid acceleration. We find that the
local helicity polarization induced by thermal vorticity dominates over other
contributions. It also implies that in the low-energy collisions, the the fluid
vorticity as part of thermal vorticity may play the crucial role to the total
helicity polarization. Such a finding could be useful for probing the local
strength of vorticity in rotational quark gluon plasmas by measuring helicity
polarization. Our simulation confirms the strict space reversal symmetry,

the largest cluster which may contain the information related to the order

melting of the magnetic long-range order into an isotropic gas-like paramagnet
proceeds via an intermediate stage where the classical spins remain
anisotropically correlated. This correlated paramagnet exists in a temperature
range $T_N < T < T^\ast$, whose width increases as magnetic frustrations grow.
This intermediate phase is typically characterized by short-range correlations,
however the two-dimensional nature of the model allows for an additional exotic

locations, which simulations show are ideal sites for planetesimal formation.
Here we show that our Solar System may have formed from rings of planetesimals

sublimation line (at $T \sim$1400~K), water snowline (at $T \sim$170~K), and
CO-snowline (at $T \sim$30~K). Our simulations show that dust piles up at the

wide ring between $\sim$3-4~au and $\sim$10-20~au, and a distant ring between
$\sim$20~au and $\sim$45~au. We use a series of simulations to follow the

shed new light on naturalness of the electroweak and flavor sectors, with a
rich TeV scale phenomenology. Usually, such models are formulated in the
framework of local effective field theories. The scope of this article is to
propose new model building issues with EDS and branes, arising in the framework
of string-inspired infinite derivative quantum field theories (QFT's), which
are perturbatively exorcized (ghost-free) and intrinsically nonlocal above some
ultraviolet (UV) scale. First, a toy model with bulk and brane scalar fields is
presented. It is shown that a 4D field localized on a $\delta$-like 3-brane is
still delocalized in the bulk on a small distance from the brane position, with
a penetration depth given by the nonlocal length scale. Fields localized on
such distant fuzzy branes are thus allowed to interact directly with suppressed
couplings, which is impossible in a local QFT. It is also argued that above the
nonlocal scale, it should be much more difficult to probe the Kaluza-Klein (KK)
tower in an experiment, because of the UV-opaqueness of such infinite
derivative QFT's. In this way, a shadow EDS is obtained if the nonlocal and
KK-scales are close to each other, such that the effects of the KK-excitations
are screened compared to a local QFT. After that, directions for model building
are given. By using this new possibility of fuzzy branes, a new realization of
split fermions in an EDS is presented, allowing to naturally generate flavor
hierarchies. Moreover, with a warped EDS, the usual warp transmutation of a
brane mass term is revisited, where it is shown that the nonlocal scale is also
redshifted. This may provide a new way to solve or reduce the little hierarchy
problem related to the Higgs boson mass.","['hep-th', 'hep-ph']",2021-12-31,['Florian Nortier']

various massive binary BH population models, featuring competing prescriptions
for the Delays between galaxy and BH mergers, for the impact of supernova
feedback on massive BH growth, and for the initial population of high redshift
BH seeds (light versus heavy seeds). For each of these scenarios, we compute
the average number of expected events for precision BH spectroscopy using a
Fisher-matrix analysis. We find that, for any heavy seed scenario, LISA will
measure the dominant mode frequency within ${\cal O}(0.1) \%$ relative
uncertainty and will estimate at least 3 independent QNM parameters within $1
\%$ error. The most optimistic heavy seed scenarios produce $\mathcal{O}(100)$
events with $1 \%$ measurability for 3 or more QNM quantities during LISA's
operational time. On the other hand, light seed scenarios produce lighter
merger remnants, which ring at frequencies higher than LISA's sensitivity.
Interestingly, the light seed models give rise to a fraction of mergers in the

suggest that massive BHs, including intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can
form in galactic nuclei through collisions between stellar-mass black holes and
the surrounding main-sequence stars. Considering dynamical processes such as
collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation, we find that this channel can be
quite efficient, forming IMBHs as massive as $10^4$ M$_\odot$. Our results
suggest that massive black holes and IMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic
centres. This formation channel also has implications for observations.
Collisions between stars and BHs can produce electromagnetic signatures, for
example, from x-ray binaries and tidal disruption events. Additionally, formed
through this channel, both black holes in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with
the supermassive black hole at the center of a galactic nucleus through
gravitational waves. These gravitational wave events are extreme and

G34.26$+$0.25, which increases the number of high-mass star-forming regions

months) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity of the (9,6) maser in
G34.26$+$0.25 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to
the Effelsberg data and assuming linear variations between the epochs of
observation, the JVLA data indicate no missing flux. This suggests that the
NH$_3$ (9,6) emission arises from single compact emission regions that are not
resolved by the interferometric measurements. As JVLA imaging shows, the
NH$_{3}$ (9,6) emission in Cep A originates from a sub-arcsecond sized region,
slightly to the west of the peak position of the 1.36\,cm continuum object,
HW2. In G34.26$+$0.25, three NH$_{3}$ (9,6) maser spots are observed: one is

126,"Relative Defects in Relative Theories: Trapped Higher-Form Symmetries
  and Irregular Punctures in Class S","A relative theory is a boundary condition of a higher-dimensional topological
quantum field theory (TQFT), and carries a non-trivial defect group formed by
mutually non-local defects living in the relative theory. Prime examples are 6d
N=(2,0) theories that are boundary conditions of 7d TQFTs, with the defect
group arising from surface defects. In this paper, we study codimension-two
defects in 6d N=(2,0) theories, and find that the line defects living inside
these codimension-two defects are mutually non-local and hence also form a
defect group. Thus, codimension-two defects in a 6d N=(2,0) theory are relative
defects living inside a relative theory. These relative defects provide
boundary conditions for topological defects of the 7d bulk TQFT. A
codimension-two defect carrying a non-trivial defect group acts as an irregular
puncture when used in the construction of 4d N=2 Class S theories. The defect
group associated to such an irregular puncture provides extra ""trapped""
contributions to the 1-form symmetries of the resulting Class S theories. We
determine the defect groups associated to large classes of both conformal and
non-conformal irregular punctures. Along the way, we discover many new classes
of irregular punctures. A key role in the analysis of defect groups is played
by two different geometric descriptions of the punctures in Type IIB string
theory: one provided by isolated hypersurface singularities in Calabi-Yau
threefolds, and the other provided by ALE fibrations with monodromies.",['hep-th'],2021-12-31,"['Lakshya Bhardwaj', 'Simone Giacomelli', 'Max Hubner', 'Sakura Schafer-Nameki']"

Based on quantum probability statistics the GBI and violation are formulated in
an unified manner with the help of state density operator, which can be
separated to local and non-local parts. The local part gives rise to the
inequality, while the non-local part is responsible for the violation. The GBI
is not violated at all by quantum average except the spin-$1/2$ entangled
states. If the measuring outcomes are restricted in the subspace of spin
coherent state (SCS), namely, only the maximum spin values $\pm s$, the GBI is
still meaningful for the incomplete measurement. With the help of SCS quantum
probability statistics, it is proved that the violation of GBI can occur only
for half-integer spins but not integer spins. Moreover, the maximum violation
bound depends on the number parity of entangled particles, that it is $1/2$ for
the odd particle-numbers while $1$ for even numbers.",['quant-ph'],2021-12-31,"['Yan Gu', 'Wei-Dong Li', 'Xiao-Lei Hao', 'Jiu-Qing Liang', 'Lian-Fu Wei']"

leading to a susy vacua of the resolved conifold. It possesses the non-Abelian
global symmetry SU(2)xSU(2). A non-Abelian T-duality can be constructed which
can be described by gauging the global non-Abelian symmetry. This leads to a
dual action, in terms of the dual model Kaehler and superpotential terms, which
include twisted chiral superfields dependence. Comparing the effective
potentials for the U(1) fields on the original and the dual models we determine
the instanton corrections to the dual action. We obtain the supersymmetry vacua
solution of the dual model, in three cases: first in an Abelian direction
inside SU(2)xSU(2), then for an Abelian direction considering instanton
corrections and finally for a semi-chiral non Abelian vector superfield. The
dual geometry for all of these cases (SUSY vacua space) is given by T5xR.
However the instanton corrections restrict the Fayet-Iliopoulos term to be zero

  Gramian constraint","A fast algorithm for the large-scale joint inversion of gravity and magnetic
data is developed. It uses a nonlinear Gramian constraint to impose correlation
between density and susceptibility of reconstructed models. The global
objective function is formulated in the space of the weighted parameters, but
the Gramian constraint is implemented in the original space, and the nonlinear
constraint is imposed using two separate Lagrange parameters, one for each
model domain. This combined approach provides more similarity between the
reconstructed models. It is assumed that the measured data are obtained on a
uniform grid and that a consistent regular discretization of the volume domain
is imposed. The sensitivity matrices exhibit a block Toeplitz Toeplitz block
structure for each depth layer of the model domain. Forward and transpose
operations with the matrices can be implemented efficiently using two
dimensional fast Fourier transforms. This makes it feasible to solve for large
scale problems with respect to both computational costs and memory demands, and
to solve the nonlinear problem by applying iterative methods that rely only on
matrix vector multiplications. As such, the use of the regularized reweighted
conjugate gradient algorithm, in conjunction with the structure of the
sensitivity matrices, leads to a fast methodology for large-scale joint
inversion of geophysical data sets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that it
is possible to apply a nonlinear joint inversion algorithm, with $L_p$-norm
stabilisers, for the reconstruction of large model domains on a standard laptop
computer. It is demonstrated, that the p=1 choice provides sparse reconstructed
solutions with sharp boundaries, and $p=2$ provides smooth and blurred models.

important ingredient in understanding large-scale structure formation, require
more conservative particle resolution than those required by halo mass alone in
a simulation. This reduces the parameter space of the simulations, more
severely for high-redshift and large-volume mocks which are required by the
next-generation large sky surveys. Here, we incorporate redshift and cosmology
dependence into an algorithm that assigns accurate halo properties such as
concentration, spin, velocity, and spatial distribution to the sub-resolution
haloes in a simulation. By focusing on getting the right correlations with halo
mass and local tidal anisotropy $\alpha$ measured at $4 \times$ halo radius,
our method will also recover the correlations of these small scale structural
properties with the large-scale environment, i.e., the halo assembly bias at
all scales greater than $5 \times$ halo radius. We find that the distribution
of halo properties is universal with redshift and cosmology. By applying the
algorithm to a large volume simulation $(600 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})$, we can access
the $30-500$ particle haloes, thus gaining an order of magnitude in halo mass
and two to three orders of magnitude in number density at $z=2-4$. This
technique reduces the cost of mocks required for the estimation of covariance

that quantum algorithms can describe the PES of the SN2 reaction. In noise
simulations, UCCSD is more susceptible to quantum noise than k-UpCCGSD.
Therefore, k-UpCCGSD can serve as an alternative to UCCSD to reduce quantum
noisy effects in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, and k-UpCCGSD is

a good understanding of proton beam emittance growth and particle loss

  Assuming nominal design parameters, simulations show that for a bunched beam,
the bulk of emittance growth takes place immediately following injection,

simplified RMS mismatch theory; some of its limitations and possible
improvements are briefly discussed. We then compare theoretical predictions to

mitigate emittance growth and reduce particle loss, we compare two beam

center of the nonlinear (octupole) insertion region where $\beta_x = \beta_y$.
To observe how nonlinearity affects emittance growth and whether it dominates

and the $q$-voter model with anticonformity, we discuss how the change of
disorder from annealed to quenched affects phase transitions on networks. Up
till now, such an analysis has been done only at the mean-field level. To
derive phase diagrams on networks, we develop the pair approximation for the
quenched versions of the models. This formalism can be also applied to other
quenched dynamics of similar kind. The results indicate that such a change of
disorder eliminates all discontinuous phase transitions and broadens ordered
phases. We show that although the annealed and quenched types of disorder lead
to the same result in the $q$-voter model with anticonformity at the mean-field
level, they do lead to distinct phase diagrams on networks. These phase
diagrams shift towards each other as the average node degree of a network
increases, and eventually, they coincide in the mean-field limit. In contrast,
for the $q$-voter model with independence, the phase diagrams move towards the
same direction regardless of the disorder type, and they do not coincide even
in the mean-filed limit. To validate our results, we carry out Monte Carlo

interest due to their hosting of Majorana zero modes. In long junctions, i.e.
junctions where the junction length exceeds the superconducting coherence
length, TJJs manifest themselves in specific features of the critical current.
Here we propose to couple the helical edge states mediating the TJJ to
additional channels or quantum dots, by which the effective junction length can
be increased by tunable parameters associated with these couplings, so that
such measurements become possible even in short junctions. Besides effective
low-energy models that we treat analytically, we investigate realizations by a
Kane-Mele model with edge passivation and treat them numerically via tight
binding models. In each case, we explicitly calculate the critical current
using the Andreev bound state spectrum and show that it differs in effective
long junctions in the cases of strong and weak parity changing perturbations

different doping metal atoms has been investigated to elucidate the impact of
the dopant on the structures. With DFT simulation results, the zinc group atoms

gold group and plantinum group data can be summarized in the perspective of
balance between the ligand-core binding and core cohesive energies. Most of
dopants drive the modeled nanoclusters away from the balance especially when
the metal atom replaced the gold atom in gold-sulfur bindings. But when cores
of the nanoclusters are dominated by gold atoms, the dopants may achieve

For the rescaled equations, we prove that the steady flow (Taylor-Couette flow)
is asymptotically stable up to a large perturbation of initial data. Back to
the original 2D Navier-Stokes equations, this implies an improved transition
threshold for the Taylor-Couette flow. The improvement is due to enhanced
dissipation and new observations and constructions of weighted $L^2$ norms,
which capture a hidden structure between the viscosity constant $\nu$ and
(different) rotating speeds and locations of two coaxial cylinders. In
particular, we allow the location of the outer cylinder to tend to infinity,
which renders the initial fluid kinetic energy not uniformly bounded. Due to
enhanced-dissipation effect, we also establish a sharp resolvent estimate,
desired space-time bounds and optimal decaying estimates, which lead to the

  C/2014 UN271 and C/2017 K2","In June 2021 the discovery of an unusual comet C/2014 UN271
Bernardinelli-Bernstein has been announced. Its cometary activity beyond Uranus
orbit also has refreshed interest in similar objects, including C/2017K2
PanSTARRS. Another peculiarity of these objects is the long interval of
positional data, taken at large heliocentric distances. These two comets are
suitable candidates for a detailed investigation of their long-term motion
outside the planetary zone. Using the selected orbital solutions, we aim at
estimating the orbital parameters of their orbits at the previous perihelion
passage. This might allow us to discriminate between dynamically old and new
comets. To follow the dynamical evolution of long-period comets far outside the
planetary zone, it is necessary to take into account both the perturbation
caused by the overall Galactic gravitational potential and the actions of
individual stars appearing in the solar neighborhood. To this aim, we applied
the recently published methods based on stellar perturbers ephemerides. For
C/2014 UN271 we obtained a precise orbital solution that can be propagated to
the past and to the future. For C/2017 K2 we have to limit ourselves to study
only the past motion since some signs of nongravitational effects can be found
in recent positional observations. Therefore, we use a specially selected
orbital solution suitable for past motion studies. Using these starting orbits,
we propagated both comets to their previous perihelia. We also investigated the
future motion of C/2014 UN271. Orbital evolution of these two comets appears to
be sensitive to perturbations from several stars that closely approach the Sun.
Unfortunately, some of these stars have 6D data with uncertainties too large to
obtain definitive results for the studied comets; however, it appears that both
comets were probably outside the planetary zone in the previous perihelion.","['astro-ph.EP', 'astro-ph.GA', 'astro-ph.SR']",2021-12-31,"['Piotr A. Dybczyński', 'Małgorzata Królikowska']"
155,Coronal Quasi-periodic Fast-mode Propagating Wave Trains,"QFP wave trains in the corona have been studied intensively in the past
decade, thanks to the full-disk, high spatiotemporal resolution, and
wide-temperature coverage observations taken by the SDO/AIA. In AIA
observations, QFP wave trains are seen to consist of multiple coherent and
concentric wavefronts emanating successively near the epicenter of the
accompanying flares; they propagate outwardly either along or across coronal
loops at fast-mode magnetosonic speeds from several hundred to more than 2000
km/s, and their periods are in the range of tens of seconds to several minutes.
Based on the distinct different properties of QFP wave trains, they might be
divided into two distinct categories including narrow and broad ones. For most
QFP wave trains, some of their periods are similar to those of quasi-periodic
pulsations (QPPs) in the accompanying flares, indicating that they are probably
different manifestations of the same physical process. Currently, candidate
generation mechanisms for QFP wave trains include two main categories: pulsed
energy excitation mechanism in association with magnetic reconnection and
dispersion evolution mechanism related to the dispersive evolution of
impulsively generated broadband perturbations. In addition, the generation of
some QFP wave trains might be driven by the leakage of three and five minute
oscillations from the lower atmosphere. As one of the new discoveries of SDO,
QFP wave trains provide a new tool for coronal seismology to probe the corona
parameters, and they are also useful for diagnosing the generation of QPPs,
flare processes including energy release and particle accelerations. This
review aims to summarize the main observational and theoretical results of the
spatially-resolved QFP wave trains in extreme ultraviolet observations, and

(SCR; Yuan et al. 2015a) method to recalibrate the SDSS Stripe 82 standard
stars catalog of Ivezi\'c et al. (2007). With a total number of about 30,000
spectroscopically targeted stars, we have mapped out the relatively large and
strongly correlated photometric zero-point errors present in the catalog,
$\sim$2.5 per cent in the $u$ band and $\sim$ 1 per cent in the $griz$ bands.
Our study also confirms some small but significant magnitude dependence errors
in the $z$ band for some charge-coupled devices. Various tests show that we
have achieved an internal precision of about 5 mmag in the $u$ band and about 2
mmag in the $griz$ bands, which is about 5 times better than previous results.
We also apply the method to the latest version of the catalog (V4.2; Thanjavur

cent along the R.A. direction and smaller errors along the Dec. direction. The
results demonstrate the power of the SCR method when combining spectroscopic
data and Gaia photometry in breaking the 1 percent precision barrier of
ground-based photometric surveys. Our work paves the way for the re-calibration

thermal evolution, adopting the relativistic Cowling approximation. We
particularly focus on the neutron star models, in which the direct Urca (rapid
cooling process) does not work, without the superfluidity and
superconductivity. For such models, the cooling curve hardly depends on the
equation of state (EOS) as well as the mass of neutron star, while we show that
the gravitational wave frequencies strongly depend on the both properties.
Then, we find that the frequencies of the fundamental and the 1st pressure mode
multiplied with the stellar mass are well expressed as a function of the
stellar compactness almost independently of the EOS. We also find that the
frequency of the 1st gravity mode in later phase of the thermal evolution is
strongly correlated with the stellar compactness. In addition, we derive the
empirical formula estimating the threshold mass for the onset of the direct
Urca inside the neutron star as a function of the nuclear saturation parameter.
This formula will give us a constraint on the neutron star properties, if it
would be observationally found that the direct Urca occurs (or does not work)

and determine its properties such as mass and the spin. For this purpose we
study spin zero and spin one-half cases of dark matter, $D$ which belongs to
$SU(2)$ weak doublet and therefore has the charged doublet partner, $D^+$. For
the case of scalar dark matter we chose Inert Doublet Model, while for the case
of fermion dark matter we suggest the new minimal fermion dark matter model
with only three parameters. We choose two benchmarks for the models under study
which provide the correct amount of observed DM relic density and consistent
with the current DM searches. We focus on the particular process $e^+ e^- \to
D^+ D^- \to D D W^+ W^- \to DD(q \bar{q})(\mu^\pm\nu)$ at 500 GeV ILC collider
which gives rise to the ""di-jet +$\mu$ + missing $E_T$"" signature and study it
at the level of fast detector simulation, taking into account Bremsstrahlung
and ISR effects. We have found that two kinematical observables -- the energy
of the muon, $E_\mu$, and the angular distribution of $W$-boson, reconstructed
from di-jet, $\cos\theta_{jj}$ are very powerful in determination of DM mass
and spin, respectively. In particular we have demonstrated that in case of
fermion DM, the masses can be measured with a few percent accuracy already at
500 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. At the same time, the scalar DM model
which has about an order of magnitude lower signal, requires about factor of 40
higher luminosity to reach the same accuracy in the mass measurement. We have
found that one can distinguish fermion and scalar DM scenarios with about 2
ab$^{-1}$ total integrated luminosity or less without using the information on

162,"The impact of outgassing of CO2 and prior calcium precipitation to the
  isotope composition of calcite precipitated on stalagmites. Implications for
  reconstructing climate information from proxies","Degassing of CO2 and precipitation of calcite to the surface of stalagmites
can strongly impact isotope signals imprinted into the calcite of these
speleothems. Here, we show that in all the variety of conditions occurring in
nature only two distinct types of degassing exist. First, when a thin film of
calcareous solution comes in contact to cave air lower pCO2 value than that of
the aqueous CO2 in the water, molecular CO2 escapes by physical diffusion in
several seconds. In a next step lasting several ten seconds, pH and DIC in the
solution achieve chemical equilibrium with respect to the CO2 in the cave
atmosphere. This solution becomes supersaturated with respect to calcite.
During precipitation for each unit CaCO3 deposited one molecule of CO2 is
generated and escapes from the solution. This precipitation driven degassing is
active during precipitation only. We show that all variations of out gassing
proposed in the literature are either diffusive outgassing or precipitation
driven degassing and that diffusive outgassing has no influence on the isotope
composition of the HCO3 - pool and consequently on that of calcite. Its isotope
imprint is determined solely by precipitation driven degassing in contrast to
most explanations in the literature. We present a theoretical model of d13C and
d18O that explains the contributions of various parameters such as changes in
temperature, changes of pCO2 in the cave atmosphere, and changes in the drip
intervals to the isotope composition of calcite precipitated to the apex of the
stalagmite. We use this model to calculate quantitatively changes of d13C and
d18O observed in field experiments (Carlson et al., 2020) in agreement to their
experimental data. We also apply our model to prior calcite precipitation (PCP)
in the field as reported by Mickler et al. (2019). We discuss how PCP

163,Probing Majorana Modes via Local Spin Dynamics,"We investigate Majorana modes in a quantum spin chain with bond-dependent
exchange interactions by studying its dynamics. Specifically, we consider
two-time correlations for the Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) Hamiltonian close to the
so-called Kitaev critical point. Here, the model coincides with a phase
boundary of two uncoupled instances of Kitaev's model for p-wave
superconductors, together supporting a degenerate ground state characterized by
multiple Majorana modes. In this regime, the real-time dynamics of local spins
reveal a set of strong zero modes, corresponding to a set of protruding
frequencies in the two-time correlation function. We derive perturbative
interactions that map the KH spin chain onto the topological regime of Kitaev's
fermionic model, thus opening up a bulk gap whilst retaining almost degenerate
modes in the mesoscopic regime, i.e., for finite system sizes. This showcases
the emergence of Majorana modes in a chain of effective dimers. Here, the
binding energy within each unit cell competes with the inter-dimer coupling to
generate a finite size energy gap, in analogy with local energy terms in the
transverse-field Ising model. These modes give rise to long coherence times of
local spins located at the system edges. By breaking the local symmetry in each
dimer, one can also observe a second class of Majorana modes in terms of a
beating frequency in the two-time correlations function of the edge spin.
Furthermore, we develop a scenario for realizing these model predictions in

these modes are known to induce modulated phases. Here, we consider modulated
phases induced by the fourth mode. We develop a theory for tetrahedral order in
liquid crystals, and show that it couples to the $\Delta$ mode of director
deformation. Because of geometric frustration, the $\Delta$ mode cannot fill

However, other Kerr-like rotating black holes of modified gravity theories
cannot be ignored, and they are essential as they offer an arena in which these
theories can be tested through astrophysical observation. This motivates us to
investigate asymptotically de Sitter rotating black holes wherein interpreting
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as the vacuum energy leads to a deformation
in the vicinity of a black hole -- new Kerr--de Sitter solution, which has a
richer geometric structure than the original one. We derive an analytical

then visualize the shadow of black holes for various parameters for an observer

estimate the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from its shadow observables. The

equation in which sequential and coutuneling terms are taken into account. In
the presence of intradot Coulomb interactions, a plateau in the

diminishes at a high thermal bias between the leads. It is shown that the
Pauli, the Redfield, the Lindblad-type equation with first order tunneling

transport indicating the conservation of coherency in the electron transport in
sequential tunneling between the QD and leads. In contrast, the thermal
transport is suppressed when coutuneling processes are taken into account via a
second-order von-Neumann master equation. The consideration of second order
effects with respect to the QD-leads coupling brings in a wealth of virtual
processes at the contact to each lead. These virtual processes directly weaken
the effects of the contribution of the first order direct processes to the

174,The dynamics and observability of circularly polarized kink waves,"Context. Kink waves are routinely observed in coronal loops. Resonant
absorption is a well-accepted mechanism that extracts energy from kink waves.
Nonlinear kink waves are know to be affected by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. However, all previous numerical studies consider linearly
polarized kink waves. Aims. We study the properties of circularly polarized
kink waves on straight plasma cylinders, for both standing and propagating
waves, and compare them to the properties of linearly polarized kink waves.
Methods. We use the code MPI-AMRVAC to solve the full 3D Magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) equations for a straight magnetic cylinder, excited by both standing and
propagating circularly polarized kink (m = 1) modes. Results. The damping due
to resonant absorption is independent of the polarization state. The morphology
or appearance of the induced resonant flow is different for the two
polarizations, however, there are essentially no differences in the
forward-modeled Doppler signals. For nonlinear oscillations, the growth rate of
small scales is determined by the total energy of the oscillation rather than
the perturbation amplitude. We discuss possible implications and seismological
relevance.","['astro-ph.SR', 'physics.plasm-ph']",2021-12-30,"['N. Magyar', 'T. Duckenfield', 'T. Van Doorsselaere', 'V. M. Nakariakov']"

the same term and temporal correlation. The objective is to clarify the
relationship between the urn model and the Hawkes process. Correlation in the
same term is represented by the P\'{o}lya urn model and the temporal
correlation is incorporated by introducing the conditional initial condition.
In the double-scaling limit of this urn process, the self-exciting negative
binomial distribution (SE-NBD) process, which is a marked point process, is
obtained. In the standard continuous limit, this process becomes the Hawkes
process, which has no correlation in the same term. The difference is the
variance of the intensity function in that the phase transition from the steady
to the non-steady state can be observed. The critical point, at which the power
law distribution is obtained, is the same for the Hawkes and the urn processes.
These two processes are used to analyze empirical data of financial default to
estimate the parameters of the model. For the default portfolio, the results
produced by the urn process are superior to those obtained with the Hawkes

177,A free energy principle for generic quantum systems,"The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that under suitable conditions of weak
coupling, random dynamical systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will
behave so as to minimize an upper bound, formalized as a variational free
energy, on surprisal (a.k.a., self-information). This upper bound can be read
as a Bayesian prediction error. Equivalently, its negative is a lower bound on
Bayesian model evidence (a.k.a., marginal likelihood). In short, certain random
dynamical systems evince a kind of self-evidencing. Here, we reformulate the
FEP in the formal setting of spacetime-background free, scale-free quantum
information theory. We show how generic quantum systems can be regarded as
observers, which with the standard freedom of choice assumption become agents
capable of assigning semantics to observational outcomes. We show how such
agents minimize Bayesian prediction error in environments characterized by
uncertainty, insufficient learning, and quantum contextuality. We show that in
its quantum-theoretic formulation, the FEP is asymptotically equivalent to the
Principle of Unitarity. Based on these results, we suggest that biological
systems employ quantum coherence as a computational resource and - implicitly -
as a communication resource. We summarize a number of problems for future
research, particularly involving the resources required for classical
communication and for detecting and responding to quantum context switches.","['quant-ph', 'q-bio.NC']",2021-12-30,"['Chris Fields', 'Karl Friston', 'James F. Glazebrook', 'Michael Levin']"

ultraviolet (EUV) waves (collectively, secondary waves) have been observed
during their interactions with coronal structures such as active regions (ARs)
and coronal holes (CHs). However, the effect of the total reflection of EUV
waves has not been reported in the literature. Here, we present the first
unambiguous observational evidence of the total reflection of a quasi-periodic
EUV wave train during its interaction with a polar CH. The event occurred in
NOAA AR 12473, located close to the southeast limb of the solar disk, and was
characterized by a jet-like CME. In this study, we focus in particular on the
driving mechanism s of the quasi-periodic wave train and the total reflection
effect at the CH boundary. We find that the periods of the incident and the
reflected wave trains are both about 100 seconds. The excitation of the
quasi-periodic wave train was possibly due to the intermittent energy release
in the associated flare since its period is similar to that of the
quasi-periodic pulsations in the associated flare. Our observational results
showed that the reflection of the wave train at the boundary of the CH was a
total reflection because the measured incidence and critical angles satisfy the

180,"Information flow, Gating, and Energetics in dimeric molecular motors","Molecular motors belonging to the kinesin and myosin super family hydrolyze
ATP by cycling through a sequence of chemical states. These cytoplasmic motors
are dimers made up of two linked identical monomeric globular proteins. Fueled
by the free energy generated by ATP hydrolysis, the motors walk on polar tracks
(microtubule or filamentous actin) processively, which means that only one head
detaches and executes a mechanical step while the other stays bound to the
track. Thus, the one motor head must regulate chemical state of the other,
referred to as ""gating"", a concept that is not fully understood. Inspired by
experiments, showing that only a fraction of the energy from ATP hydrolysis is
used to advance the kinesin motors against load, we demonstrate that additional
energy is used for coordinating the chemical cycles of the two heads in the
dimer - a feature that characterizes gating. To this end, we develop a general
framework based on information theory and stochastic thermodynamics, and
establish that gating could be quantified in terms of information flow between
the motor heads. Applications of the theory to kinesin-1 and Myosin V show that
information flow occurs, with positive cooperativity, at external resistive
loads that are less than a critical value, $F_c$. When force exceeds $F_c$,
effective information flow ceases. Interestingly, $F_c$, which is independent
of the input energy generated through ATP hydrolysis, coincides with force at
which the probability of backward steps starts to increase. Our findings
suggest that transport efficiency is optimal only at forces less than $F_c$,
which implies that these motors must operate at low loads under $\textit{in
vivo}$ conditions.","['physics.bio-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'q-bio.BM']",2021-12-30,"['Ryota Takaki', 'Mauro L. Mugnai', 'D. Thirumalai']"

the deformation parameter b can be regarded as an analog of the cosmological
constant characterizing the deformation of the Poincare group into the de
Sitter (anti-de Sitter) group. The simplicity and naturalness of Finslerian

production \textbf{in} the Crab Nebula is carefully studied in a spatially
dependent lepto-hadronic model. In our model, the dynamical evolution of the
PWN is simulated in a spherically symmetric system. Both electrons and protons
are accelerated at the termination shock. The relevant particle propagation

For the Crab Nebula, our results reveal that the observed multi-band photon
spectra can be well reproduced with reasonable model parameters. In particular,
the photons with energy $\gtrsim 200$ TeV are mainly contributed by the
hadronic component via proton-proton interaction. The contribution of the
hadronic component depends on both proton spectral index $\alpha_{\rm p}$ and
number density $n_{\rm H}$ of medium within the PWN. Besides, high energy
neutrino fluxes are predicted with variable proton spectral indices. The

  ultrasonic cavitation bubbles in solutions of varying concentrations","Ultrasonic irradiation of liquids, such as water-alcohol solutions, results
in cavitation or the formation of small bubbles. Cavitation bubbles are
generated in real solutions without the use of optical traps making our system
as close to real conditions as possible. Under the action of the ultrasound,
bubbles can grow, oscillate, and eventually, they collapse or decompose. We
apply the mathematical method of separation of motions to interpret the
acoustic effect on the bubbles. While in most situations, the spherical shape
of a bubble is the most energetically profitable as it minimizes the surface
energy, when the acoustic frequency is in resonance with the natural frequency
of the bubble, shapes with the dihedral symmetry emerge. Some of these
resonance shapes turn unstable, so the bubble decomposes. It turns out that
bubbles in the solutions of different concentrations (with different surface
energies and densities) attain different evolution paths. While it is difficult
to obtain a deterministic description of how the solution concentration affects
bubble dynamics, it is possible to separate images with different
concentrations by applying the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. An
ANN was trained to detect the concentration of alcohol in a water solution
based on the bubble images. This indicates that Artificial Intelligence (AI)

For this new equation of fourth order for the dynamics of the scale factor, we
study numerical solutions. Typical solutions show a radiation-like Big Bang for
the early universe and de Sitter-like expansion for the late universe. We
discuss a specific solution to the cosmological horizon problem that can be
produced by tuning parameters in the given equation. Although the model

unexplainability, starts from a new perspective on deniability, and leads to a
natural common view of deniability in the classical and quantum settings. We
give a construction which is secure in the random oracle model, assuming the

of scalar field, respectively. Our study could be a good preparation for one to
further understand the black hole scalarization in dS spacetime.",['gr-qc'],2021-12-30,"['Zhen-Hao Yang', 'Guoyang Fu', 'Xiao-Mei Kuang', 'Jian-Pin Wu']"
198,On the mass of the glueballonium,"According to lattice simulations and other theoretical approaches, the scalar
glueball is the lightest state in the Yang-Mills sector of QCD. Since within
this sector the scalar glueball is stable, the scattering between two glueballs
is a well-defined process. Moreover, a glueball-glueball bound state, called
glueballonium, might exist if the attraction turns out to be large enough. In
this work, we concentrate on the formation of the glueballonium in the context
of the dilaton potential. In particular, we investigate the parameter values
for which such a glueballonium emerges.",['hep-ph'],2021-12-30,"['Enrico Trotti', 'Francesco Giacosa']"
199,Real-Time Dynamics at Large $N$,"The large-$N$ limit of $O(N)$-symmetric bosonic field theories, or
$U(N)$-symmetric fermionic field theories, is amenable to a saddle point
approximation. As a result, there is a family of closely related algorithms for
efficient lattice simulations in this limit, even in the presence of fermionic
or real-time sign problems. These can be used to study quenches, or other
observables for which",['hep-lat'],2021-12-30,['Scott Lawrence']
