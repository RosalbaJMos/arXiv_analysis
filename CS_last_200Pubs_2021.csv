0,"A Markov Decision Process Framework for Efficient and Implementable
  Contact Tracing and Isolation","Efficient contact tracing and isolation is an effective strategy to control
epidemics. It was used effectively during the Ebola epidemic and successfully
implemented in several parts of the world during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
An important consideration in contact tracing is the budget on the number of
individuals asked to quarantine -- the budget is limited for socioeconomic
reasons. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to
formulate the problem of using contact tracing to reduce the size of an
outbreak while asking a limited number of people to quarantine. We formulate
each step of the MDP as a combinatorial problem, MinExposed, which we
demonstrate is NP-Hard; as a result, we develop an LP-based approximation
algorithm. Though this algorithm directly solves MinExposed, it is often
impractical in the real world due to information constraints. To this end, we
develop a greedy approach based on insights from the analysis of the previous
algorithm, which we show is more interpretable. A key feature of the greedy
algorithm is that it does not need complete information of the underlying
social contact network. This makes the heuristic implementable in practice and
is an important consideration. Finally, we carry out experiments on simulations
of the MDP run on real-world networks, and show how the algorithms can help in
bending the epidemic curve while limiting the number of isolated individuals.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the greedy algorithm and its variants
are especially effective, robust, and practical in a variety of realistic
scenarios, such as when the contact graph and specific transmission
probabilities are not known. All code can be found in our GitHub repository:

1,Deconfounded Visual Grounding,"We focus on the confounding bias between language and location in the visual
grounding pipeline, where we find that the bias is the major visual reasoning
bottleneck. For example, the grounding process is usually a trivial
language-location association without visual reasoning, e.g., grounding any
language query containing sheep to the nearly central regions, due to that most
queries about sheep have ground-truth locations at the image center. First, we
frame the visual grounding pipeline into a causal graph, which shows the
causalities among image, query, target location and underlying confounder.
Through the causal graph, we know how to break the grounding bottleneck:
deconfounded visual grounding. Second, to tackle the challenge that the
confounder is unobserved in general, we propose a confounder-agnostic approach
called: Referring Expression Deconfounder (RED), to remove the confounding
bias. Third, we implement RED as a simple language attention, which can be
applied in any grounding method. On popular benchmarks, RED improves various
state-of-the-art grounding methods by a significant margin. Code will soon be
available at: https://github.com/JianqiangH/Deconfounded_VG.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CL']",2021-12-31,"['Jianqiang Huang', 'Yu Qin', 'Jiaxin Qi', 'Qianru Sun', 'Hanwang Zhang']"
2,Binary Diffing as a Network Alignment Problem via Belief Propagation,"In this paper, we address the problem of finding a correspondence, or
matching, between the functions of two programs in binary form, which is one of
the most common task in binary diffing. We introduce a new formulation of this
problem as a particular instance of a graph edit problem over the call graphs
of the programs. In this formulation, the quality of a mapping is evaluated
simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph
similarities. We show that this formulation is equivalent to a network
alignment problem. We propose a solving strategy for this problem based on
max-product belief propagation. Finally, we implement a prototype of our
method, called QBinDiff, and propose an extensive evaluation which shows that
our approach outperforms state of the art diffing tools.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-31,"['Elie Mengin', 'Fabrice Rossi']"
3,"Improved Algorithm for the Network Alignment Problem with Application to
  Binary Diffing","In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to address the Network Alignment
problem. It is inspired from a previous message passing framework of Bayati et
al. [2] and includes several modifications designed to significantly speed up
the message updates as well as to enforce their convergence. Experiments show
that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art solvers. Finally, we
propose an application of our method in order to address the Binary Diffing
problem. We show that our solution provides better assignment than the
reference differs in almost all submitted instances and outline the importance
of leveraging the graphical structure of binary programs.","['cs.LG', 'cs.DC', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-31,"['Elie Mengin', 'Fabrice Rossi']"
4,"Using Graph-Aware Reinforcement Learning to Identify Winning Strategies
  in Diplomacy Games (Student Abstract)","This abstract proposes an approach towards goal-oriented modeling of the
detection and modeling complex social phenomena in multiparty discourse in an
online political strategy game. We developed a two-tier approach that first
encodes sociolinguistic behavior as linguistic features then use reinforcement
learning to estimate the advantage afforded to any player. In the first tier,
sociolinguistic behavior, such as Friendship and Reasoning, that speakers use
to influence others are encoded as linguistic features to identify the
persuasive strategies applied by each player in simultaneous two-party
dialogues. In the second tier, a reinforcement learning approach is used to
estimate a graph-aware reward function to quantify the advantage afforded to
each player based on their standing in this multiparty setup. We apply this
technique to the game Diplomacy, using a dataset comprising of over 15,000
messages exchanged between 78 users. Our graph-aware approach shows robust
performance compared to a context-agnostic setup.","['cs.CL', 'cs.CY']",2021-12-31,"['Hansin Ahuja', 'Lynnette Hui Xian Ng', 'Kokil Jaidka']"
5,On Distinctive Properties of Universal Perturbations,"We identify properties of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) that
distinguish them from standard adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we show
that targeted UAPs generated by projected gradient descent exhibit two
human-aligned properties: semantic locality and spatial invariance, which
standard targeted adversarial perturbations lack. We also demonstrate that UAPs
contain significantly less signal for generalization than standard adversarial
perturbations -- that is, UAPs leverage non-robust features to a smaller extent
than standard adversarial perturbations.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV']",2021-12-31,"['Sung Min Park', 'Kuo-An Wei', 'Kai Xiao', 'Jerry Li', 'Aleksander Madry']"
6,"Temporal aware Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network For Session-based
  Recommendation","Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging task, which aims at
recommending next items based on anonymous interaction sequences. Despite the
superior performance of existing methods for SBR, there are still several
limitations: (i) Almost all existing works concentrate on single interest
extraction and fail to disentangle multiple interests of user, which easily
results in suboptimal representations for SBR. (ii) Furthermore, previous
methods also ignore the multi-form temporal information, which is significant
signal to obtain current intention for SBR. To address the limitations
mentioned above, we propose a novel method, called \emph{Temporal aware
Multi-Interest Graph Neural Network} (TMI-GNN) to disentangle multi-interest
and yield refined intention representations with the injection of two level
temporal information. Specifically, by appending multiple interest nodes, we
construct a multi-interest graph for current session, and adopt the GNNs to
model the item-item relation to capture adjacent item transitions,
item-interest relation to disentangle the multi-interests, and interest-item
relation to refine the item representation. Meanwhile, we incorporate
item-level time interval signals to guide the item information propagation, and
interest-level time distribution information to assist the scattering of
interest information. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that
TMI-GNN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods consistently.",['cs.IR'],2021-12-31,"['Qi Shen', 'Shixuan Zhu', 'Yitong Pang', 'Yiming Zhang', 'Zhihua Wei']"
7,Sufficient Statistic Memory AMP,"Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent, and
2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring performance improvement).
As an example, we construct a sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP
(SS-BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if its state evolution has a unique fixed
point. In addition, the mean square error (MSE) of SS-BO-MAMP is not worse than
the original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity
and accuracy of the theoretical results.","['cs.IT', 'cs.LG', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2021-12-31,"['Lei Liu', 'Shunqi Huang', 'Brian M. Kurkoski']"
8,Toward the Analysis of Graph Neural Networks,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a robust framework for
graph-structured data. They have been applied to many problems such as
knowledge graph analysis, social networks recommendation, and even Covid19
detection and vaccine developments. However, unlike other deep neural networks
such as Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), few analyses such as verification
and property inferences exist, potentially due to dynamic behaviors of GNNs,
which can take arbitrary graphs as input, whereas FFNNs which only take fixed
size numerical vectors as inputs.
  This paper proposes an approach to analyze GNNs by converting them into FFNNs
and reusing existing FFNNs analyses. We discuss various designs to ensure the
scalability and accuracy of the conversions. We illustrate our method on a
study case of node classification. We believe that our approach opens new
research directions for understanding and analyzing GNNs.","['cs.SE', 'cs.LG']",2021-12-31,"['Thanh-Dat Nguyen', 'Thanh Le-Cong', 'ThanhVu H. Nguyen', 'Xuan-Bach D. Le', 'Quyet-Thang Huynh']"
9,Data-Driven Optimal Control of Bilinear Systems,"This paper develops a method to learn optimal controls from data for bilinear
systems without a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Given an unknown
bilinear system, we first characterize when the available data is suitable to
solve the optimal control problem. This characterization leads us to propose an
online control experiment design procedure that guarantees that any input/state
trajectory can be represented as a linear combination of collected input/state
data matrices. Leveraging this data-based representation, we transform the
original optimal control problem into an equivalent data-based optimization
problem with bilinear constraints. We solve the latter by iteratively employing
a convex-concave procedure to convexify it and find a locally optimal control
sequence. Simulations show that the performance of the proposed data-based
approach is comparable with model-based methods.","['math.OC', 'cs.SY', 'eess.SY']",2021-12-31,"['Zhenyi Yuan', 'Jorge Cortes']"
10,"A Deep Learning Approach to Integrate Human-Level Understanding in a
  Chatbot","In recent times, a large number of people have been involved in establishing
their own businesses. Unlike humans, chatbots can serve multiple customers at a
time, are available 24/7 and reply in less than a fraction of a second. Though
chatbots perform well in task-oriented activities, in most cases they fail to
understand personalized opinions, statements or even queries which later impact
the organization for poor service management. Lack of understanding
capabilities in bots disinterest humans to continue conversations with them.
Usually, chatbots give absurd responses when they are unable to interpret a
user's text accurately. Extracting the client reviews from conversations by
using chatbots, organizations can reduce the major gap of understanding between
the users and the chatbot and improve their quality of products and
services.Thus, in our research we incorporated all the key elements that are
necessary for a chatbot to analyse and understand an input text precisely and
accurately. We performed sentiment analysis, emotion detection, intent
classification and named-entity recognition using deep learning to develop
chatbots with humanistic understanding and intelligence. The efficiency of our
approach can be demonstrated accordingly by the detailed analysis.","['cs.CL', 'cs.LG']",2021-12-31,"['Afia Fairoose Abedin', 'Amirul Islam Al Mamun', 'Rownak Jahan Nowrin', 'Amitabha Chakrabarty', 'Moin Mostakim', 'Sudip Kumar Naskar']"
11,"InverseMV: Composing Piano Scores with a Convolutional Video-Music
  Transformer","Many social media users prefer consuming content in the form of videos rather
than text. However, in order for content creators to produce videos with a high
click-through rate, much editing is needed to match the footage to the music.
This posts additional challenges for more amateur video makers. Therefore, we
propose a novel attention-based model VMT (Video-Music Transformer) that
automatically generates piano scores from video frames. Using music generated
from models also prevent potential copyright infringements that often come with
using existing music. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work besides
the proposed VMT that aims to compose music for video. Additionally, there
lacks a dataset with aligned video and symbolic music. We release a new dataset
composed of over 7 hours of piano scores with fine alignment between pop music
videos and MIDI files. We conduct experiments with human evaluation on VMT,
SeqSeq model (our baseline), and the original piano version soundtrack. VMT
achieves consistent improvements over the baseline on music smoothness and
video relevance. In particular, with the relevance scores and our case study,
our model has shown the capability of multimodality on frame-level actors'
movement for music generation. Our VMT model, along with the new dataset,
presents a promising research direction toward composing the matching
soundtrack for videos. We have released our code at

13,SplitBrain: Hybrid Data and Model Parallel Deep Learning,"The recent success of deep learning applications has coincided with those
widely available powerful computational resources for training sophisticated
machine learning models with huge datasets. Nonetheless, training large models
such as convolutional neural networks using model parallelism (as opposed to
data parallelism) is challenging because the complex nature of communication
between model shards makes it difficult to partition the computation
efficiently across multiple machines with an acceptable trade-off. This paper
presents SplitBrain, a high performance distributed deep learning framework
supporting hybrid data and model parallelism. Specifically, SplitBrain provides
layer-specific partitioning that co-locates compute intensive convolutional
layers while sharding memory demanding layers. A novel scalable group
communication is proposed to further improve the training throughput with
reduced communication overhead. The results show that SplitBrain can achieve
nearly linear speedup while saving up to 67\% of memory consumption for data

14,Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks,"We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-31,"['Raul Astudillo', 'Peter I. Frazier']"

  Explainable AI","Despite recent advances in modern machine learning algorithms, the opaqueness
of their underlying mechanisms continues to be an obstacle in adoption. To
instill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence systems, Explainable
Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a response to improving modern machine
learning algorithms' explainability. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a
subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in
generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven
framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate
explainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background
knowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP
need to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example,
existing ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced
solutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances. This survey paper
summarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical
relational learning and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic
views to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate
observed challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated
research toward developing self-explanatory artificial intelligence systems.",['cs.LG'],2021-12-31,"['Zheng Zhang', 'Levent Yilmaz', 'Bo Liu']"

  Discriminators","Recent advances in deep generative models have led to immense progress in 3D
shape synthesis. While existing models are able to synthesize shapes
represented as voxels, point-clouds, or implicit functions, these methods only
indirectly enforce the plausibility of the final 3D shape surface. Here we
present a 3D shape synthesis framework (SurfGen) that directly applies
adversarial training to the object surface. Our approach uses a differentiable
spherical projection layer to capture and represent the explicit zero
isosurface of an implicit 3D generator as functions defined on the unit sphere.
By processing the spherical representation of 3D object surfaces with a
spherical CNN in an adversarial setting, our generator can better learn the
statistics of natural shape surfaces. We evaluate our model on large-scale
shape datasets, and demonstrate that the end-to-end trained model is capable of

18,"Transformer Embeddings of Irregularly Spaced Events and Their
  Participants","We propose an approach to modeling irregularly spaced sequences of discrete
events. We begin with a continuous-time variant of the Transformer, which was
originally formulated (Vaswani et al., 2017) for sequences without timestamps.
We embed a possible event (or other boolean fact) at time $t$ by using
attention over the events that occurred at times $< t$ (and the facts that were
true when they occurred). We control this attention using pattern-matching
logic rules that relate events and facts that share participants. These rules
determine which previous events will be attended to, as well as how to
transform the embeddings of the events and facts into the attentional queries,
keys, and values. Other logic rules describe how to change the set of facts in
response to events. Our approach closely follows Mei et al. (2020a), and adopts
their Datalog Through Time formalism for logic rules. As in that work, a domain
expert first writes a set of logic rules that establishes the set of possible
events and other facts at each time $t$. Each possible event or other fact is
embedded using a neural architecture that is derived from the rules that
established it. Our only difference from Mei et al. (2020a) is that we derive a
flatter, attention-based neural architecture whereas they used a more serial
LSTM architecture. We find that our attention-based approach performs about
equally well on the RoboCup dataset, where the logic rules play an important
role in improving performance. We also compared these two methods with two
previous attention-based methods (Zuo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a) on
simpler synthetic and real domains without logic rules, and found our proposed
approach to be at least as good, and sometimes better, than each of the other
three methods.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LO']",2021-12-31,"['Chenghao Yang', 'Hongyuan Mei', 'Jason Eisner']"
19,Multi-Dimensional Model Compression of Vision Transformer,"Vision transformers (ViT) have recently attracted considerable attentions,
but the huge computational cost remains an issue for practical deployment.
Previous ViT pruning methods tend to prune the model along one dimension
solely, which may suffer from excessive reduction and lead to sub-optimal model
quality. In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm,
and propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and
sequence dimensions jointly. We firstly propose a statistical dependence based
pruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying
deleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multi-dimensional compression as
an optimization, learning the optimal pruning policy across the three
dimensions that maximizes the compressed model's accuracy under a computational
budget. The problem is solved by our adapted Gaussian process search with
expected improvement. Experimental results show that our method effectively
reduces the computational cost of various ViT models. For example, our method
reduces 40\% FLOPs without top-1 accuracy loss for DeiT and T2T-ViT models,
outperforming previous state-of-the-arts.","['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']",2021-12-31,"['Zejiang Hou', 'Sun-Yuan Kung']"
20,"Avoiding Catastrophe: Active Dendrites Enable Multi-Task Learning in
  Dynamic Environments","A key challenge for AI is to build embodied systems that operate in
dynamically changing environments. Such systems must adapt to changing task
contexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems
achieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in
dynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can
interfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired
architectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the
biophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable
networks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific
manner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel
artificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and
sparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we
study the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring
task-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning
environment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation
tasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's
prediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks
demonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,
allowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.
Our neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has
achieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning
settings. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can

  learning","We consider large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with an unknown cost
function and employ stochastic convex optimization tools to address the problem
of imitation learning, which consists of learning a policy from a finite set of
expert demonstrations.
  We adopt the apprenticeship learning formalism, which carries the assumption
that the true cost function can be represented as a linear combination of some
known features. Existing inverse reinforcement learning algorithms come with
strong theoretical guarantees, but are computationally expensive because they
use reinforcement learning or planning algorithms as a subroutine. On the other

IM-TRPO, and GAIL), achieve significant empirical success in challenging
benchmark tasks, but are not well understood in terms of theory. With an
emphasis on non-asymptotic guarantees of performance, we propose a method that
directly learns a policy from expert demonstrations, bypassing the intermediate
step of learning the cost function, by formulating the problem as a single
convex optimization problem over occupancy measures. We develop a

learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an
iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing
using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection

where the stochastic optimal policies are required to be robust with respect to
the ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. Our work is at the
crossroads of two important schemes in reinforcement learning (RL), namely,
robust MDP and entropy regularized MDP. We show that essential properties that
hold for the non-robust ER-MDP and robust unregularized MDP models also hold in
our settings, making the robust ER-MDP problem tractable. We show how our
framework and results can be integrated into different algorithmic schemes

address this, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP). We

than conventional cellular networks. To this end, previous works have shown how
to perform system-wide max-min fairness power allocation when using maximum
ratio precoding. In this paper, we first generalize this method to arbitrary
precoding, and then train a neural network to perform approximately the same
power allocation but with reduced computational complexity. Finally, we train
one neural network per AP to mimic system-wide max-min fairness power
allocation, but using only local information. By learning the structure of the
local propagation environment, this method outperforms the state-of-the-art
distributed power allocation method from the Cell-free Massive MIMO literature.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-31,"['Sucharita Chakraborty', 'Emil Björnson', 'Luca Sanguinetti']"
27,"Calibrated Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction via Graph-based
  Self-Tuning Network","Recently, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has attracted increasing research
attention, especially for the ones based on a coded aperture snapshot spectral
imaging (CASSI) system. Existing deep HSI reconstruction models are generally
trained on paired data to retrieve original signals upon 2D compressed
measurements given by a particular optical hardware mask in CASSI, during which
the mask largely impacts the reconstruction performance and could work as a
""model hyperparameter"" governing on data augmentations. This mask-specific
training style will lead to a hardware miscalibration issue, which sets up
barriers to deploying deep HSI models among different hardware and noisy
environments. To address this challenge, we introduce mask uncertainty for HSI
with a complete variational Bayesian learning treatment and explicitly model it
through a mask decomposition inspired by real hardware. Specifically, we
propose a novel Graph-based Self-Tuning (GST) network to reason uncertainties
adapting to varying spatial structures of masks among different hardware.
Moreover, we develop a bilevel optimization framework to balance HSI
reconstruction and uncertainty estimation, accounting for the hyperparameter
property of masks. Extensive experimental results and model discussions
validate the effectiveness (over 33/30 dB) of the proposed GST method under two
miscalibration scenarios and demonstrate a highly competitive performance
compared with the state-of-the-art well-calibrated methods. Our code and

28,"Human and Machine Type Communications can Coexist in Uplink Massive MIMO
  Systems","Future cellular networks are expected to support new communication paradigms
such as machine-type communication (MTC) services along with human-type
communication (HTC) services. This requires base stations to serve a large
number of devices in relatively short channel coherence intervals which renders
allocation of orthogonal pilot sequence per-device approaches impractical.
Furthermore, the stringent power constraints, place-and-play type connectivity
and various data rate requirements of MTC devices make it impossible for the
traditional cellular architecture to accommodate MTC and HTC services together.
Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MaMIMO) technology has the potential to
allow the coexistence of HTC and MTC services, thanks to its inherent spatial
multiplexing properties and low transmission power requirements. In this work,
we investigate the performance of a single cell under a shared physical channel
assumption for MTC and HTC services and propose a novel scheme for sharing the
time-frequency resources. The analysis reveals that MaMIMO can significantly
enhance the performance of such a setup and allow the inclusion of MTC services
into the cellular networks without requiring additional resources.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-31,"['Kamil Senel', 'Emil Björnson', 'Erik G. Larsson']"
29,BTS: An Accelerator for Bootstrappable Fully Homomorphic Encryption,"Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables secure offloading of computation to the
cloud by providing computation on encrypted data (ciphertexts). HE is based on
noisy encryption schemes such that noise accumulates as we apply more
computation to the data. The limited number of operations applicable to the
data prevents practical applications from exploiting HE. Bootstrapping enables
an unlimited number of operations or fully HE (FHE) by refreshing the
ciphertext. Unfortunately, bootstrapping requires a significant amount of
additional computation and memory bandwidth. Prior works have proposed hardware
accelerators for computation primitives of FHE. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first to propose a hardware FHE accelerator tailored to
support bootstrapping efficiently.
  In particular, we propose BTS -- Bootstrappable, Technology-driven, Secure
accelerator architecture for FHE. We identify the challenges of supporting
bootstrapping in the accelerator and analyze the off-chip memory bandwidth and
computation required. In particular, given the limitations of modern memory
technology, we identify the HE parameter sets that are efficient for FHE
acceleration. Based on the insights from our analysis, we propose BTS that
effectively exploits parallelism innate in HE operations by arranging a massive
number of processing elements in a grid. We present the design and
microarchitecture of BTS, including the network-on-chip that exploits the
deterministic communication pattern. BTS shows 5,556$\times$ and 1,306$\times$
improved execution time on ResNet-20 and logistic regression over CPU, using

31,Preference Swaps for the Stable Matching Problem,"An instance $I$ of the Stable Matching Problem (SMP) is given by a bipartite
graph with a preference list of neighbors for every vertex. A swap in $I$ is
the exchange of two consecutive vertices in a preference list. A swap can be
viewed as a smallest perturbation of $I$. Boehmer et al. (2021) designed a
polynomial-time algorithm to find the minimum number of swaps required to turn
a given maximal matching into a stable matching. To generalize this result to
the many-to-many version of SMP, we introduce a new representation of SMP as an
extended bipartite graph and reduce the problem to submodular minimization. It
is a natural problem to establish computational complexity of deciding whether
at most $k$ swaps are enough to turn $I$ into an instance where one of the
maximum matchings is stable. Using a hardness result of Gupta et al. (2020), we
prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether at most $k$ swaps are enough to turn
$I$ into an instance with a stable perfect matching. Moreover, this problem
parameterized by $k$ is W[1]-hard. We also obtain a lower bound on the running
time for solving the problem using the Exponential Time Hypothesis.","['cs.DS', 'cs.DM', 'math.CO']",2021-12-31,"['Eduard Eiben', 'Gregory Gutin', 'Philip R. Neary', 'Clément Rambaud', 'Magnus Wahlström', 'Anders Yeo']"

35,"Formal Verification of Unknown Dynamical Systems via Gaussian Process
  Regression","Leveraging autonomous systems in safety-critical scenarios requires verifying
their behaviors in the presence of uncertainties and black-box components that
influence the system dynamics. In this article, we develop a framework for
verifying partially-observable, discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodelled
dynamics against temporal logic specifications from a given input-output
dataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to
learn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstract the continuous-space
system as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This
abstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals
that capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using
reproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced
by discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for
verification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic
specification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification
results on the abstraction to the underlying partially-observable system. We
show that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the
size of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis
illustrates a trade-off between the quality of the verification results and the
computational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions. Finally,
we demonstrate the efficacy of our learning and verification framework on
several case studies with linear, nonlinear, and switched dynamical systems.","['eess.SY', 'cs.AI', 'cs.SY']",2021-12-31,"['John Jackson', 'Luca Laurenti', 'Eric Frew', 'Morteza Lahijanian']"
36,BARACK: Partially Supervised Group Robustness With Guarantees,"While neural networks have shown remarkable success on classification tasks
in terms of average-case performance, they often fail to perform well on
certain groups of the data. Such group information may be expensive to obtain;
thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve
worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training
data. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group
information at training time. In this work, we assume access to a small number
of group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose
BARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information
to improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group
labels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a
robust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds
for our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, showing how the
generalization error scales with respect to both the total number of training
points and the number of training points with group labels. Empirically, our
method outperforms the baselines that do not use group information, even when

real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are
traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their
increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration,
substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle
this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.
State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform
demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However,
they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close
the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general
pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural
networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the
network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization
techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the
network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in
the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity.
  Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into

problems. It has been seen that as time progresses, the number of problems
humans face also increases. However, technology to resolve these problems tends

the invention of vehicles was parking. The ease of resolving this problem using
technology has evolved over the years but the problem of parking still remains
unsolved. The main reason behind this is that parking does not only involve one
problem but it consists of a set of problems within itself. One of these
problems is the occupancy detection of the parking slots in a distributed
parking ecosystem. In a distributed system, users would find preferable parking
spaces as opposed to random parking spaces. In this paper, we propose a
web-based application as a solution for parking space detection in different
parking spaces. The solution is based on Computer Vision (CV) and is built
using the Django framework written in Python 3.0. The solution works to resolve
the occupancy detection problem along with providing the user the option to

this issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network
(DS-Net) to leverage unlabeled RGB images for boosting RGB-D saliency
detection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network

branch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used
to estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the
paired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and
depth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned
as the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning.
Moreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention
and saliency maps for the unlabeled data, as well as a supervised depth and
saliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DDCNN outperforms state-of-the-art

the textual content of the tweet is aligned with the trusted news. If it is
not, the tweet is classified as fake. This approach can be generally applied to
any kind of information and is not limited to a specific news story or a

construction is formulated as the design of a multivariate Gaussian
distribution that aims to minimize the mutual information while limiting the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of the observations under
attack and the distribution of the observations without attack. The sparsity
constraint is incorporated as a support constraint of the attack distribution.
Two heuristic greedy algorithms for the attack construction are proposed. The
first algorithm assumes that the attack vector consists of independent entries,
and therefore, requires no communication between different attacked locations.
The second algorithm considers correlation between the attack vector entries
and achieves a better disruption to stealth tradeoff at the cost of requiring
communication between different locations. We numerically evaluate the

53,Robust Region Feature Synthesizer for Zero-Shot Object Detection,"Zero-shot object detection aims at incorporating class semantic vectors to
realize the detection of (both seen and) unseen classes given an unconstrained
test image. In this study, we reveal the core challenges in this research area:
how to synthesize robust region features (for unseen objects) that are as
intra-class diverse and inter-class separable as the real samples, so that
strong unseen object detectors can be trained upon them. To address these
challenges, we build a novel zero-shot object detection framework that contains
an Intra-class Semantic Diverging component and an Inter-class Structure
Preserving component. The former is used to realize the one-to-more mapping to
obtain diverse visual features from each class semantic vector, preventing
miss-classifying the real unseen objects as image backgrounds. While the latter
is used to avoid the synthesized features too scattered to mix up the
inter-class and foreground-background relationship. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive experiments on PASCAL
VOC, COCO, and DIOR datasets are conducted. Notably, our approach achieves the
new state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO and it is the first
study to carry out zero-shot object detection in remote sensing imagery.",['cs.CV'],2021-12-31,"['Peiliang Huang', 'Junwei Han', 'De Cheng', 'Dingwen Zhang']"
54,"Croesus: Multi-Stage Processing and Transactions for Video-Analytics in
  Edge-Cloud Systems","Emerging edge applications require both a fast response latency and complex
processing. This is infeasible without expensive hardware that can process
complex operations -- such as object detection -- within a short time. Many
approach this problem by addressing the complexity of the models -- via model
compression, pruning and quantization -- or compressing the input. In this
paper, we propose a different perspective when addressing the performance
challenges. Croesus is a multi-stage approach to edge-cloud systems that
provides the ability to find the balance between accuracy and performance.
Croesus consists of two stages (that can be generalized to multiple stages): an
initial and a final stage. The initial stage performs the computation in
real-time using approximate/best-effort computation at the edge. The final
stage performs the full computation at the cloud, and uses the results to
correct any errors made at the initial stage. In this paper, we demonstrate the
implications of such an approach on a video analytics use-case and show how
multi-stage processing yields a better balance between accuracy and
performance. Moreover, we study the safety of multi-stage transactions via two
proposals: multi-stage serializability (MS-SR) and multi-stage invariant

inspect by narrowing it down to only a subset of relevant program statements.
However, despite an extensive body of research showing its usefulness, dynamic
slicing is still short from production-level use due to the high cost of
runtime instrumentation.
  As an alternative, we propose statistical program slicing, a novel hybrid
dynamic-static slicing technique that explores the trade-off between accuracy
and runtime cost. Our approach relies on modern hardware support for control
flow monitoring and a novel, cooperative heap memory tracing mechanism combined
with static program analysis for data flow tracking. We evaluate statistical

approach iCaps, which allows tracking 6D poses of unseen objects in a category
and estimating their 3D shapes. We develop a category-level auto-encoder
network using depth images as input, where feature embeddings from the
auto-encoder encode poses of objects in a category. The auto-encoder can be
used in a particle filter framework to estimate and track 6D poses of objects
in a category. By exploiting an implicit shape representation based on signed
distance functions, we build a LatentNet to estimate a latent representation of
the 3D shape given the estimated pose of an object. Then the estimated pose and
shape can be used to update each other in an iterative way. Our category-level
6D object pose and shape estimation pipeline only requires 2D detection and
segmentation for initialization. We evaluate our approach on a publicly

equal size with a one-to-one correspondence between points. The data point
clouds are allowed to lie in different ambient spaces. The RTD is one of the
few TDA-based practical methods applicable to real machine learning datasets.
Experiments show that the proposed RTD agrees with the intuitive assessment of
data representation similarity and is sensitive to its topological structure.

training and testing. In this paper, we introduce a simple variational
objective whose optima are exactly the set of all representations on which risk
minimizers are guaranteed to be robust to any distribution shift that preserves
the Bayes predictor, e.g., covariate shifts. Our objective has two components.
First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some
predictor must be able to simultaneously minimize the source and target risk.
Second, the representation's marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised learning
methods that only use unlabelled data and augmentations to train robust
representations. Our objectives achieve state-of-the-art results on DomainBed,

generated samples often relies on human evaluation, which is subjective and
costly. We focus on designing a homogeneous, objective framework for evaluating
samples of algorithmically generated music. Any engineered measures to evaluate
generated music typically attempt to define the samples' musicality, but do not
capture qualities of music such as theme or mood. We do not seek to assess the
musical merit of generated music, but instead explore whether generated samples
contain meaningful information pertaining to emotion or mood/theme. We achieve
this by measuring the change in predictive performance of a music mood/theme
classifier after augmenting its training data with generated samples. We
analyse music samples generated by three models -- SampleRNN, Jukebox, and DDSP
-- and employ a homogeneous framework across all methods to allow for objective
comparison. This is the first attempt at augmenting a music genre
classification dataset with conditionally generated music. We investigate the
classification performance improvement using deep music generation and the
ability of the generators to make emotional music by using an additional,
emotion annotation of the dataset. Finally, we use a classifier trained on real

60,PatchTrack: Multiple Object Tracking Using Frame Patches,"Object motion and object appearance are commonly used information in multiple
object tracking (MOT) applications, either for associating detections across
frames in tracking-by-detection methods or direct track predictions for
joint-detection-and-tracking methods. However, not only are these two types of
information often considered separately, but also they do not help optimize the
usage of visual information from the current frame of interest directly. In
this paper, we present PatchTrack, a Transformer-based
joint-detection-and-tracking system that predicts tracks using patches of the
current frame of interest. We use the Kalman filter to predict the locations of
existing tracks in the current frame from the previous frame. Patches cropped
from the predicted bounding boxes are sent to the Transformer decoder to infer
new tracks. By utilizing both object motion and object appearance information
encoded in patches, the proposed method pays more attention to where new tracks
are more likely to occur. We show the effectiveness of PatchTrack on recent MOT
benchmarks, including MOT16 (MOTA 73.71%, IDF1 65.77%) and MOT17 (MOTA 73.59%,

61,Quality-aware Part Models for Occluded Person Re-identification,"Occlusion poses a major challenge for person re-identification (ReID).
Existing approaches typically rely on outside tools to infer visible body
parts, which may be suboptimal in terms of both computational efficiency and
ReID accuracy. In particular, they may fail when facing complex occlusions,
such as those between pedestrians. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a
novel method named Quality-aware Part Models (QPM) for occlusion-robust ReID.
First, we propose to jointly learn part features and predict part quality
scores. As no quality annotation is available, we introduce a strategy that
automatically assigns low scores to occluded body parts, thereby weakening the
impact of occluded body parts on ReID results. Second, based on the predicted
part quality scores, we propose a novel identity-aware spatial attention (ISA)
module. In this module, a coarse identity-aware feature is utilized to
highlight pixels of the target pedestrian, so as to handle the occlusion
between pedestrians. Third, we design an adaptive and efficient approach for
generating global features from common non-occluded regions with respect to
each image pair. This design is crucial, but is often ignored by existing
methods. QPM has three key advantages: 1) it does not rely on any outside tools
in either the training or inference stages; 2) it handles occlusions caused by
both objects and other pedestrians;3) it is highly computationally efficient.
Experimental results on four popular databases for occluded ReID demonstrate
that QPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant
margins. The code of QPM will be released.",['cs.CV'],2021-12-31,"['Pengfei Wang', 'Changxing Ding', 'Zhiyin Shao', 'Zhibin Hong', 'Shengli Zhang', 'Dacheng Tao']"

blockchain protocols from their low scalability. However, such technique also
brings several potential risks and huge communication overheads. An improper
design may give rise to the inconsistent state among different committees.
Further, the communication overheads arising from cross-shard transactions
unfortunately reduce the system's performance. In this paper, we first
summarize five essential issues that all sharding blockchain designers face.
For each issue, we discuss its key challenge and propose our suggested
solutions. In order to break the performance bottlenecks, we propose a
reputation mechanism for selecting leaders. The term of reputation in our
design reflects each node's honest computation resources. In addition, we
introduce a referee committee and partial sets in each committee, and design a
recovery procedure in case the leader is malicious. Under the design, we prove
that malicious leaders will not hurt the system and will be evicted.
Furthermore, we conduct a series of simulations to evaluate our design. The
results show that selecting leaders by the reputation can dramatically improve

63,"Role of Data Augmentation Strategies in Knowledge Distillation for
  Wearable Sensor Data","Deep neural networks are parametrized by several thousands or millions of
parameters, and have shown tremendous success in many classification problems.
However, the large number of parameters makes it difficult to integrate these
models into edge devices such as smartphones and wearable devices. To address
this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a
pre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for
edge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and
challenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful
application of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during
training. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for
choosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the
results of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices
and some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity
analysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many
comprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices.
Our study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one
derived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and
sedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques
during KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the
optimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to
a dataset at hand. However, we also conclude with a general set of
recommendations that can provide a strong baseline performance across
databases.","['cs.LG', 'cs.HC', 'eess.SP']",2021-12-31,"['Eun Som Jeon', 'Anirudh Som', 'Ankita Shukla', 'Kristina Hasanaj', 'Matthew P. Buman', 'Pavan Turaga']"

  theory-guided convolutional neural network","Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number
of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to
solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale
geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution
grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to
be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency
remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed
to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve
upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship
between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic
heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while
solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws
(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be
incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed
the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical
information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep
learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are
introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based
upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic
cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent
upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved

To address this problem, this paper proposes a scene-adaptive attention
network, termed SAANet. First of all, we design a deformable attention in-built
Transformer backbone, which learns adaptive feature representations with
deformable sampling locations and dynamic attention weights. Then we propose
the multi-level feature fusion and count-attentive feature enhancement modules
further, to strengthen feature representation under the global image context.
The learned representations could attend to the foreground and are adaptive to
different scales of crowds. We conduct extensive experiments on four

gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can
influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the
classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to
observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional

our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most
important information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the
visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal

tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGLv2, a system that extends DistDGL for

training to scale to large graphs. DistDGLv2 places graph data in distributed
CPU memory and performs mini-batch computation in GPUs. DistDGLv2 distributes
the graph and its associated data (initial features) across the machines and
uses this distribution to derive a computational decomposition by following an
owner-compute rule. DistDGLv2 follows a synchronous training approach and
allows ego-networks forming mini-batches to include non-local nodes. To
minimize the overheads associated with distributed computations, DistDGLv2 uses
a multi-level graph partitioning algorithm with min-edge cut along with
multiple balancing constraints. This localizes computation in both machine
level and GPU level and statically balance the computations. DistDGLv2 deploys
an asynchronous mini-batch generation pipeline that makes all computation and

visual object localization tasks. However, bounding-box annotation relies on a
large amount of precisely annotating bounding boxes, and it is expensive and
laborious. It is impossible to be employed in practical scenarios and even
redundant for some applications (such as tiny person localization) that the
size would not matter. Therefore, we propose a novel point-based framework for
the person localization task by annotating each person as a coarse point
(CoarsePoint) instead of an accurate bounding box that can be any point within
the object extent. Then, the network predicts the person's location as a 2D
coordinate in the image. Although this greatly simplifies the data annotation
pipeline, the CoarsePoint annotation inevitably decreases label reliability
(label uncertainty) and causes network confusion during training. As a result,
we propose a point self-refinement approach that iteratively updates point
annotations in a self-paced way. The proposed refinement system alleviates the
label uncertainty and progressively improves localization performance.

79,"Privacy-Protecting COVID-19 Exposure Notification Based on Cluster
  Events","We provide a rough sketch of a simple system design for exposure notification
of COVID-19 infections based on copresence at cluster events -- locations and
times where a threshold number of tested-positive (TP) individuals were
present. Unlike other designs, such as DP3T or the Apple-Google
exposure-notification system, this design does not track or notify based on
detecting direct proximity to TP individuals.
  The design makes use of existing or in-development tests for COVID-19 that
are relatively cheap and return results in less than an hour, and that have
high specificity but may have lower sensitivity. It also uses readily available
location tracking for mobile phones and similar devices. It reports events at
which TP individuals were present but does not link events with individuals or
with other events in an individual's history. Participating individuals are
notified of detected cluster events. They can then compare these locally to
their own location history. Detected cluster events can be publicized through
public channels. Thus, individuals not participating in the reporting system
can still be notified of exposure.
  A proper security analysis is beyond the scope of this design sketch. We do,
however, discuss resistance to various adversaries and attacks on privacy as
well as false-reporting attacks.","['cs.CR', 'cs.CY']",2021-12-31,['Paul Syverson']
80,"3-D Material Style Transfer for Reconstructing Unknown Appearance in
  Complex Natural Materials","We propose a 3-D material style transfer framework for reconstructing
invisible (or faded) appearance properties in complex natural materials. Our
algorithm addresses the technical challenge of transferring appearance
properties from one object to another of the same material when both objects
have intricate, noncorresponding color patterns. Eggshells, exoskeletons, and
minerals, for example, have patterns composed of highly randomized layers of
organic and inorganic compounds. These materials pose a challenge as the
distribution of compounds that determine surface color changes from object to
object and within local pattern regions. Our solution adapts appearance
observations from a material property distribution in an exemplar to the
material property distribution of a target object to reconstruct its unknown
appearance. We use measured reflectance in 3-D bispectral textures to record
changing material property distributions. Our novel implementation of spherical
harmonics uses principles from chemistry and biology to learn relationships
between color (hue and saturation) and material composition and concentration
in an exemplar. The encoded relationships are transformed to the property
distribution of a target for color recovery and material assignment.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods show that we replicate color
patterns more accurately than methods that only rely on shape correspondences
and coarse-level perceptual differences. We demonstrate applications of our
work for reconstructing color in extinct fossils, restoring faded artifacts and
generating synthetic textures.",['cs.CV'],2021-12-31,"['Shashank Ranjan', 'Corey Toler-Franklin']"

models. Such datasets usually require a heavy workload of annotations, which
are extremely time-consuming and expensive. To accelerate the annotation
procedure, multiple annotators may be employed to label different subsets of
the data. However, the inconsistency and bias among different annotators are
harmful to the model training, especially for qualitative and subjective
tasks.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
regression framework to address the disjoint annotations problem, where each
sample is labeled by only one annotator and multiple annotators work on
disjoint subsets of the data. To take account of both the intra-annotator
consistency and inter-annotator inconsistency, two strategies are
employed.Firstly, a contrastive-based loss is applied to learn the relative
ranking among different samples of the same annotator, with the assumption that
the ranking of samples from the same annotator is unanimous. Secondly, we apply
the gradient reversal layer to learn robust representations that are invariant
to different annotators. Experiments on the facial expression prediction task,

Control approaches that encapsulate production functions as services have shown

Artificial Intelligence approaches that can be utilized in order to overcome
the aforementioned challenges is given. For this purpose, we focus on planning

92,SOK: On the Analysis of Web Browser Security,"Web browsers are integral parts of everyone's daily life. They are commonly
used for security-critical and privacy sensitive tasks, like banking
transactions and checking medical records. Unfortunately, modern web browsers
are too complex to be bug free (e.g., 25 million lines of code in Chrome), and
their role as an interface to the cyberspace makes them an attractive target
for attacks. Accordingly, web browsers naturally become an arena for
demonstrating advanced exploitation techniques by attackers and
state-of-the-art defenses by browser vendors. Web browsers, arguably, are the
most exciting place to learn the latest security issues and techniques, but
remain as a black art to most security researchers because of their
fast-changing characteristics and complex code bases.
  To bridge this gap, this paper attempts to systematize the security landscape

exploitation techniques, and deployed defenses. More specifically, we first
introduce a unified architecture that faithfully represents the security design

  Gramian constraint","A fast algorithm for the large-scale joint inversion of gravity and magnetic
data is developed. It uses a nonlinear Gramian constraint to impose correlation
between density and susceptibility of reconstructed models. The global
objective function is formulated in the space of the weighted parameters, but
the Gramian constraint is implemented in the original space, and the nonlinear
constraint is imposed using two separate Lagrange parameters, one for each
model domain. This combined approach provides more similarity between the
reconstructed models. It is assumed that the measured data are obtained on a
uniform grid and that a consistent regular discretization of the volume domain
is imposed. The sensitivity matrices exhibit a block Toeplitz Toeplitz block
structure for each depth layer of the model domain. Forward and transpose
operations with the matrices can be implemented efficiently using two
dimensional fast Fourier transforms. This makes it feasible to solve for large
scale problems with respect to both computational costs and memory demands, and
to solve the nonlinear problem by applying iterative methods that rely only on
matrix vector multiplications. As such, the use of the regularized reweighted
conjugate gradient algorithm, in conjunction with the structure of the
sensitivity matrices, leads to a fast methodology for large-scale joint
inversion of geophysical data sets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that it
is possible to apply a nonlinear joint inversion algorithm, with $L_p$-norm

computer. It is demonstrated, that the p=1 choice provides sparse reconstructed
solutions with sharp boundaries, and $p=2$ provides smooth and blurred models.

statistical device activity detection under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading

accuracies and computation times. We also model device activities as random

training images are acquired from almost redundant viewpoints, we further
incorporate the spatially smoothness constraint into the estimated images by
restricting information gains from a pair of rays with slightly different
viewpoints. The main idea of our algorithm is to make reconstructed scenes
compact along individual rays and consistent across rays in the neighborhood.
The proposed regularizers can be plugged into most of existing neural volume

106,"Revisiting Experience Replay: Continual Learning by Adaptively Tuning
  Task-wise Relationship","Continual learning requires models to learn new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge. Various algorithms have been proposed to address
this real challenge. Till now, rehearsal-based methods, such as experience
replay, have achieved state-of-the-art performance. These approaches save a
small part of the data of the past tasks as a memory buffer to prevent models
from forgetting previously learned knowledge. However, most of them treat every
new task equally, i.e., fixed the hyperparameters of the framework while
learning different new tasks. Such a setting lacks the consideration of the
relationship/similarity between past and new tasks. For example, the previous
knowledge/features learned from dogs are more beneficial for the identification
of cats (new task), compared to those learned from buses. In this regard, we
propose a meta learning algorithm based on bi-level optimization to adaptively
tune the relationship between the knowledge extracted from the past and new
tasks. Therefore, the model can find an appropriate direction of gradient
during continual learning and avoid the serious overfitting problem on memory
buffer. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available
datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet). The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently improve the
performance of all baselines.","['cs.LG', 'cs.CV']",2021-12-31,"['Quanziang Wang', 'Yuexiang Li', 'Dong Wei', 'Renzhen Wang', 'Kai Ma', 'Yefeng Zheng', 'Deyu Meng']"
107,Fast Graph Subset Selection Based on G-optimal Design,"Graph sampling theory extends the traditional sampling theory to graphs with
topological structures. As a key part of the graph sampling theory, subset
selection chooses nodes on graphs as samples to reconstruct the original
signal. Due to the eigen-decomposition operation for Laplacian matrices of
graphs, however, existing subset selection methods usually require
high-complexity calculations. In this paper, with an aim of enhancing the
computational efficiency of subset selection on graphs, we propose a novel
objective function based on the optimal experimental design. Theoretical
analysis shows that this function enjoys an $\alpha$-supermodular property with
a provable lower bound on $\alpha$. The objective function, together with an
approximate of the low-pass filter on graphs, suggests a fast subset selection
method that does not require any eigen-decomposition operation. Experimental
results show that the proposed method exhibits high computational efficiency,
while having competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art ones,
especially when the sampling rate is low.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-31,"['Zhengpin Li', 'Zheng Wei', 'Jian Wang', 'Yun Lin', 'Byonghyo Shim']"
108,Deep Facial Synthesis: A New Challenge,"The goal of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive study on the facial
sketch synthesis (FSS) problem. However, due to the high costs in obtaining
hand-drawn sketch datasets, there lacks a complete benchmark for assessing the
development of FSS algorithms over the last decade. As such, we first introduce
a high-quality dataset for FSS, named FS2K, which consists of 2,104
image-sketch pairs spanning three types of sketch styles, image backgrounds,
lighting conditions, skin colors, and facial attributes. FS2K differs from
previous FSS datasets in difficulty, diversity, and scalability, and should
thus facilitate the progress of FSS research. Second, we present the
largest-scale FSS study by investigating 139 classical methods, including 24
handcrafted feature based facial sketch synthesis approaches, 37 general
neural-style transfer methods, 43 deep image-to-image translation methods, and
35 image-to-sketch approaches. Besides, we elaborate comprehensive experiments
for existing 19 cutting-edge models. Third, we present a simple baseline for
FSS, named FSGAN. With only two straightforward components, i.e., facial-aware
masking and style-vector expansion, FSGAN surpasses the performance of all
previous state-of-the-art models on the proposed FS2K dataset, by a large
margin. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned over the past years, and

contrastive learning from a clustering perspective, CARL learns unsupervised
representations by learning a set of general prototypes that serve as energy
anchors to enforce different views of a given image to be assigned to the same
prototype. Unlike contemporary work on contrastive learning with deep
clustering, CARL proposes to learn the set of general prototypes in an online
fashion, using gradient descent without the necessity of using

112,"Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution Using Dual Path Connections with
  Multiple Scale Learning","Deep convolutional neural networks have been demonstrated to be effective for
SISR in recent years. On the one hand, residual connections and dense
connections have been used widely to ease forward information and backward
gradient flows to boost performance. However, current methods use residual
connections and dense connections separately in most network layers in a
sub-optimal way. On the other hand, although various networks and methods have
been designed to improve computation efficiency, save parameters, or utilize
training data of multiple scale factors for each other to boost performance, it
either do super-resolution in HR space to have a high computation cost or can
not share parameters between models of different scale factors to save
parameters and inference time. To tackle these challenges, we propose an
efficient single image super-resolution network using dual path connections
with multiple scale learning named as EMSRDPN. By introducing dual path
connections inspired by Dual Path Networks into EMSRDPN, it uses residual
connections and dense connections in an integrated way in most network layers.
Dual path connections have the benefits of both reusing common features of
residual connections and exploring new features of dense connections to learn a
good representation for SISR. To utilize the feature correlation of multiple
scale factors, EMSRDPN shares all network units in LR space between different
scale factors to learn shared features and only uses a separate reconstruction
unit for each scale factor, which can utilize training data of multiple scale
factors to help each other to boost performance, meanwhile which can save
parameters and support shared inference for multiple scale factors to improve
efficiency. Experiments show EMSRDPN achieves better performance and comparable
or even better parameter and inference efficiency over SOTA methods.","['eess.IV', 'cs.CV', 'cs.MM']",2021-12-31,"['Bin-Cheng Yang', 'Gangshan Wu']"

  Gabidulin Codes","This paper presents a key recovery attack on the cryptosystem proposed by Lau
and Tan in a talk at ACISP 2018. The Lau-Tan cryptosystem uses Gabidulin codes
as the underlying decodable code. To hide the algebraic structure of Gabidulin
codes, the authors chose a matrix of column rank $n$ to mix with a generator
matrix of the secret Gabidulin code. The other part of the public key, however,
reveals crucial information about the private key. Our analysis shows that the
problem of recovering the private key can be reduced to solving a multivariate
linear system over the base field, rather than solving a multivariate quadratic
system as claimed by the authors. Solving the linear system for any nonzero
solution permits us to recover the private key. Apparently, this attack costs

  Sequences","Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architectures
(VSA), is a promising framework for the development of cognitive architectures
and artificial intelligence systems, as well as for technical applications and
emerging neuromorphic and nanoscale hardware. HDC/VSA operate with
hypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension
(usually > 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for
encoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs)
into hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of
hypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to
the shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical
elements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by
compositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for
representing the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the
proposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of
symbolic strings. Although our approach is feature-free as it forms the
hypervector of a sequence from the hypervectors of its symbols at their
positions, it demonstrated the performance on a par with the methods that apply
various features, such as subsequences. The proposed techniques were designed
for the HDC/VSA model known as Sparse Binary Distributed Representations.
However, they can be adapted to hypervectors in formats of other HDC/VSA

technology becomes more attractive. In this paper, we propose two effective
subarraying methods right after formulating the subarray synthesis as a
compressive sensing (CS) problem: i) Orthogonal matching pursuit based subarray
synthesis (OMP-SS), a common CS approach which can be used for the subarray
synthesis to attain the subarray information (the subarray number, the number
of elements per subarray and corresponding excitation coeffcients) and ii)
Off-grid orthogonal matching pursuit based subarray synthesis (OGOMP-SS), an
advanced approach for optimizing antenna elements positions and the subarray
information mentioned above simultaneously. In addition, two user-defined modes
are designed for different application scenarios, wherein, mode-1 is to
optimize the pattern synthesis performance for the given the number of
subarrays, and mode-2 is to obtain the minimum number of subarrays for the
cases when the pattern synthsis accuracy is satisfied. Finally, our simulation
results reveal that it is of paramount significance to optimize antenna
elements positions for the subarray synthesis performance on the one hand and
demonstrate the excellent performances of proposed schemes in comparison with
other competitive state-of-the-art subarray synthesis methods on the other

However, most existing methods demand original training data, while real data
in practice are often unavailable due to privacy, security and transmission

network without any real data. In this framework, except using the knowledge
extracted from teacher model, we introduce preset labels as additional
auxiliary information to train the generator. Then, the trained generator can

we treat preset label as ground truth label so that student network is directly

student network to mimic the attention maps of teacher model and further
improve its performance. To verify the superiority of our method, we design a
new evaluation metric is called as relative accuracy to directly compare the
effectiveness of different distillation methods. Trained portable network

120,"Settling the Bias and Variance of Meta-Gradient Estimation for
  Meta-Reinforcement Learning","In recent years, gradient based Meta-RL (GMRL) methods have achieved
remarkable successes in either discovering effective online hyperparameter for
one single task (Xu et al., 2018) or learning good initialisation for
multi-task transfer learning (Finn et al., 2017). Despite the empirical
successes, it is often neglected that computing meta gradients via vanilla
backpropagation is ill-defined. In this paper, we argue that the stochastic
meta-gradient estimation adopted by many existing MGRL methods are in fact
biased; the bias comes from two sources: 1) the compositional bias that is
inborn in the structure of compositional optimisation problems and 2) the bias
of multi-step Hessian estimation caused by direct automatic differentiation. To
better understand the meta gradient biases, we perform the first of its kind
study to quantify the amount for each of them. We start by providing a unifying
derivation for existing GMRL algorithms, and then theoretically analyse both
the bias and the variance of existing gradient estimation methods. On
understanding the underlying principles of bias, we propose two mitigation
solutions based on off-policy correction and multi-step Hessian estimation
techniques. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted and results
reveals: (1) The existence of these two biases and how they influence the
meta-gradient estimation when combined with different estimator/sample
size/step and learning rate. (2) The effectiveness of these mitigation

categories to achieve an accurate recommendation result. Specifically, we
construct a category-aware graph with both item and category nodes to represent

freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from

  How Flow-Based Samplers Scale Up","A trivializing map is a field transformation whose Jacobian determinant
exactly cancels the interaction terms in the action, providing a representation
of the theory in terms of a deterministic transformation of a distribution from
which sampling is trivial. Recently, a proof-of-principle study by Albergo,
Kanwar and Shanahan [arXiv:1904.12072] demonstrated that approximations of
trivializing maps can be `machine-learned' by a class of invertible,
differentiable neural models called \textit{normalizing flows}. By ensuring
that the Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently, asymptotically exact
sampling from the theory of interest can be performed by drawing samples from a
simple distribution and passing them through the network. From a theoretical
perspective, this approach has the potential to become more efficient than
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, where
autocorrelations severely diminish the sampling efficiency as one approaches
the continuum limit. A major caveat is that it is not yet understood how the
size of models and the cost of training them is expected to scale. As a first
step, we have conducted an exploratory scaling study using two-dimensional
$\phi^4$ with up to $20^2$ lattice sites. Although the scope of our study is

  via Geometry Constraints","Detecting 3D lanes from the camera is a rising problem for autonomous
vehicles. In this task, the correct camera pose is the key to generating
accurate lanes, which can transform an image from perspective-view to the
top-view. With this transformation, we can get rid of the perspective effects
so that 3D lanes would look similar and can accurately be fitted by low-order
polynomials. However, mainstream 3D lane detectors rely on perfect camera poses
provided by other sensors, which is expensive and encounters multi-sensor
calibration issues. To overcome this problem, we propose to predict 3D lanes by
estimating camera pose from a single image with a two-stage framework. The
first stage aims at the camera pose task from perspective-view images. To
improve pose estimation, we introduce an auxiliary 3D lane task and geometry
constraints to benefit from multi-task learning, which enhances consistencies
between 3D and 2D, as well as compatibility in the above two tasks. The second
stage targets the 3D lane task. It uses previously estimated pose to generate
top-view images containing distance-invariant lane appearances for predicting
accurate 3D lanes. Experiments demonstrate that, without ground truth camera

Unfortunately, report writing imposes a heavy burden on radiologists. To
effectively reduce such a burden, we hereby present an automatic, multi-modal
approach for report generation from chest x-ray. Our approach, motivated by the
observation that the descriptions in radiology reports are highly correlated
with the x-ray images, features two distinct modules: (i) Learned knowledge
base. To absorb the knowledge embedded in the above-mentioned correlation, we
automatically build a knowledge base based on textual embedding. (ii)
Multi-modal alignment. To promote the semantic alignment among reports, disease
labels and images, we explicitly utilize textual embedding to guide the
learning of the visual feature space. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed model using metrics from both natural language generation and clinic
efficacy on the public IU and MIMIC-CXR datasets. Our ablation study shows that
each module contributes to improving the quality of generated reports.
Furthermore, with the aid of both modules, our approach clearly outperforms

  Knowledge","Automatic radiology report generation is critical in clinics which can
relieve experienced radiologists from the heavy workload and remind
inexperienced radiologists of misdiagnosis or missed diagnose. Existing
approaches mainly formulate radiology report generation as an image captioning
task and adopt the encoder-decoder framework. However, in the medical domain,
such pure data-driven approaches suffer from the following problems: 1) visual
and textual bias problem; 2) lack of expert knowledge. In this paper, we
propose a knowledge-enhanced radiology report generation approach introduces
two types of medical knowledge: 1) General knowledge, which is input
independent and provides the broad knowledge for report generation; 2) Specific
knowledge, which is input dependent and provides the fine-grained knowledge for
report generation. To fully utilize both the general and specific knowledge, we
also propose a knowledge-enhanced multi-head attention mechanism. By merging
the visual features of the radiology image with general knowledge and specific
knowledge, the proposed model can improve the quality of generated reports.
Experimental results on two publicly available datasets IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR
show that the proposed knowledge enhanced approach outperforms state-of-the-art

machine to succeed in intelligent interactions with humans. One aspect that has
been obviated so far, is the fact that how we represent the skeletal pose has a

indepth study on various pose representations with a focus on their effects on
the motion prediction task. Moreover, recent approaches build upon
off-the-shelf RNN units for motion prediction. These approaches process input
pose sequence sequentially and inherently have difficulties in capturing

prediction which simultaneously models local motion contexts and a global
context. We further explore a geodesic loss and a forward kinematics loss for
the motion prediction task, which have more geometric significance than the
widely employed L2 loss. Interestingly, we applied our method to a range of
articulate objects including human, fish, and mouse. Empirical results show

representations and are closing the gap with supervised methods. However, these
methods are unable to acquire new knowledge incrementally -- they are, in fact,
mostly used only as a pre-training phase with IID data. In this work we
investigate self-supervised methods in continual learning regimes without
additional memory or replay. To prevent forgetting of previous knowledge, we
propose the usage of functional regularization. We will show that naive
functional regularization, also known as feature distillation, leads to low
plasticity and therefore seriously limits continual learning performance. To
address this problem, we propose Projected Functional Regularization where a
separate projection network ensures that the newly learned feature space
preserves information of the previous feature space, while allowing for the
learning of new features. This allows us to prevent forgetting while
maintaining the plasticity of the learner. Evaluation against other incremental

powerful node representations that preserve both node attributes and graph

two novel metrics: Feature Smoothness and Connection Failure Distance to guide
the subgraph sampling and mini-batch based training. Feature Smoothness is
designed for analyzing the feature of nodes in order to retain the most

decoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated

several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited
amount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to
overfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved
generalization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning

144,"Studying the Interplay between Information Loss and Operation Loss in
  Representations for Classification","Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-30,"['Jorge F. Silva', 'Felipe Tobar', 'Mario Vicuña', 'Felipe Cordova']"

sensing. However, due to the inductive bias of locality and weight sharing, the
convolution operations demonstrate the intrinsic limitations in modeling the
long-range dependency. Transformer, designed initially as a
sequence-to-sequence model, excels at capturing global contexts due to the
self-attention-based architectures even though it may be equipped with limited
localization abilities. This paper proposes CSformer, a hybrid framework that
integrates the advantages of leveraging both detailed spatial information from
CNN and the global context provided by transformer for enhanced representation
learning. The proposed approach is an end-to-end compressive image sensing
method, composed of adaptive sampling and recovery. In the sampling module,
images are measured block-by-block by the learned sampling matrix. In the
reconstruction stage, the measurement is projected into dual stems. One is the
CNN stem for modeling the neighborhood relationships by convolution, and the
other is the transformer stem for adopting global self-attention mechanism. The
dual branches structure is concurrent, and the local features and global
representations are fused under different resolutions to maximize the
complementary of features. Furthermore, we explore a progressive strategy and
window-based transformer block to reduce the parameter and computational
complexity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
dedicated transformer-based architecture for compressive sensing, which

discover global information along a sequence to leverage the contextual data.
Long sequential data traps local information such as seasonality and
fluctuations in short data sequences. In addition, the original Transformer
consumes more resources by carrying the entire attention matrix during the
training course. To overcome these challenges, ChunkFormer splits the long
sequences into smaller sequence chunks for the attention calculation,
progressively applying different chunk sizes in each stage. In this way, the
proposed model gradually learns both local and global information without

157,Deconfounded Training for Graph Neural Networks,"Learning powerful representations is one central theme of graph neural
networks (GNNs). It requires refining the critical information from the input
graph, instead of the trivial patterns, to enrich the representations. Towards
this end, graph attention and pooling methods prevail. They mostly follow the
paradigm of ""learning to attend"". It maximizes the mutual information between
the attended subgraph and the ground-truth label. However, this training
paradigm is prone to capture the spurious correlations between the trivial
subgraph and the label. Such spurious correlations are beneficial to
in-distribution (ID) test evaluations, but cause poor generalization in the
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. In this work, we revisit the GNN modeling
from the causal perspective. On the top of our causal assumption, the trivial
information serves as a confounder between the critical information and the
label, which opens a backdoor path between them and makes them spuriously
correlated. Hence, we present a new paradigm of deconfounded training (DTP)
that better mitigates the confounding effect and latches on the critical
information, to enhance the representation and generalization ability.
Specifically, we adopt the attention modules to disentangle the critical
subgraph and trivial subgraph. Then we make each critical subgraph fairly
interact with diverse trivial subgraphs to achieve a stable prediction. It
allows GNNs to capture a more reliable subgraph whose relation with the label
is robust across different distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",2021-12-30,"['Yongduo Sui', 'Xiang Wang', 'Jiancan Wu', 'Xiangnan He', 'Tat-Seng Chua']"

159,Bayesian Algorithms Learn to Stabilize Unknown Continuous-Time Systems,"Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time
period of interacting with the system.","['eess.SY', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG', 'cs.SY', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-30,"['Mohamad Kazem Shirani Faradonbeh', 'Mohamad Sadegh Shirani Faradonbeh']"
160,"A general technique for the estimation of farm animal body part weights
  from CT scans and its applications in a rabbit breeding program","Various applications of farm animal imaging are based on the estimation of
weights of certain body parts and cuts from the CT images of animals. In many
cases, the complexity of the problem is increased by the enormous variability
of postures in CT images due to the scanning of non-sedated, living animals. In
this paper, we propose a general and robust approach for the estimation of the
weights of cuts and body parts from the CT images of (possibly) living animals.
We adapt multi-atlas based segmentation driven by elastic registration and
joint feature and model selection for the regression component to cape with the
large number of features and low number of samples. The proposed technique is
evaluated and illustrated through real applications in rabbit breeding
programs, showing r^2 scores 12% higher than previous techniques and methods

two-layer graph convolution. In this work, we propose TextRGNN, an improved GNN
structure that introduces residual connection to deepen the convolution network
depth. Our structure can obtain a wider node receptive field and effectively
suppress the over-smoothing of node features. In addition, we integrate the
probabilistic language model into the initialization of graph node embedding,
so that the non-graph semantic information of can be better extracted. The
experimental results show that our model is general and efficient. It can
significantly improve the classification accuracy whether in corpus level or

of imposing non homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions in a weak form, both
on polygonal/polyhedral domains and on two/three dimensional domains with
curved boundaries. We consider a Nitsche's type method [43,41], and the
stabilized formulation of the Lagrange multiplier method proposed by Barbosa
and Hughes in [9]. We prove that also for the virtual element method (VEM),
provided the stabilization parameter is suitably chosen (large enough for
Nitsche's method and small enough for the Barbosa-Hughes Lagrange multiplier
method), the resulting discrete problem is well posed, and yields convergence
with optimal order on polygonal/polyhedral domains. On smooth two/three
dimensional domains, we combine both methods with a projection approach similar
to the one of [31]. We prove that, given a polygonal/polyhedral approximation
$\Omega_h$ of the domain $\Omega$, an optimal convergence rate can be achieved
by using a suitable correction depending on high order derivatives of the
discrete solution along outward directions (not necessarily orthogonal) at the
boundary facets of $\Omega_h$. Numerical experiments validate the theory.","['math.NA', 'cs.NA']",2021-12-30,"['Silvia Bertoluzza', 'Micol Pennacchio', 'Daniele Prada']"
163,Learning Agent State Online with Recurrent Generate-and-Test,"Learning continually and online from a continuous stream of data is
challenging, especially for a reinforcement learning agent with sequential
data. When the environment only provides observations giving partial
information about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent
state based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned
directly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent
neural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are
computationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them
unideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the
generate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test
algorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their
usefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent's performance on the
task are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly
generated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online
multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses
on the agent's ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into
the future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn
patterns in the observation signals and remember them for future predictions.
We show that our proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online
and produce accurate predictions.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",2021-12-30,"['Amir Samani', 'Richard S. Sutton']"

166,Weaving patterns inspired by the pentagon snub subdivision scheme,"Various computer simulations regarding, e.g., the weather or structural
mechanics, solve complex problems on a two-dimensional domain. They mostly do
so by splitting the input domain into a finite set of smaller and simpler
elements on which the simulation can be run fast and efficiently. This process
of splitting can be automatized by using subdivision schemes.
  Given the wide range of simulation problems to be tackled, an equally wide
range of subdivision schemes is available. They create subdivisions that are
(mainly) comprised of triangles, quadrilaterals, or hexagons. Furthermore, they
ensure that (almost) all vertices have the same number of neighboring vertices.
  This paper illustrates a subdivision scheme that splits the input domain into
pentagons. Repeated application of the scheme gives rise to fractal-like
structures. Furthermore, the resulting subdivided domain admits to certain
weaving patterns. These patterns are subsequently generalized to several other
subdivision schemes.
  As a final contribution, we provide paper models illustrating the weaving
patterns induced by the pentagonal subdivision scheme. Furthermore, we present
a jigsaw puzzle illustrating both the subdivision process and the induced
weaving pattern. These transform the visual and abstract mathematical

control problems respectively. As discovered in [W. Hager, Runge-Kutta method
in optimal control and the discrete adjoint system, Numer. Math.,2000, pp.
247-282], direct approach with RK discretization is equivalent with indirect
approach based on symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta (SPRK) integration. In
this paper, we will reconstruct this equivalence by the analogue of continuous
and discrete dynamic programming. Then, based on the equivalence, we discuss
the issue that the internal-stage controls produced by direct approach may have
lower order accuracy than the RK method used. We propose order conditions for
internal-stage controls and then demonstrate that third or fourth order
explicit RK discretization cannot avoid the order reduction phenomenon. To
overcome this obstacle, we calculate node control instead of internal-stage
controls in DLQR and ILQR methods. And numerical examples will illustrate the
validity of our methods. Another advantage of our methods is high computational
efficiency which comes from the usage of feedback technique. In this paper, we
also demonstrate that ILQR is essentially a quasi-Newton method with linear

solutions for continuous and cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this
regard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of
low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the
systolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed
framework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective
memory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual
dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential
of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and
enhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)
and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of
hand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By
capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not
unified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the
MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is
evaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance

architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances
the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed
BP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation

attracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge

transfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher

185,"ERNIE-ViLG: Unified Generative Pre-training for Bidirectional
  Vision-Language Generation","Conventional methods for the image-text generation tasks mainly tackle the
naturally bidirectional generation tasks separately, focusing on designing
task-specific frameworks to improve the quality and fidelity of the generated
samples. Recently, Vision-Language Pre-training models have greatly improved
the performance of the image-to-text generation tasks, but large-scale
pre-training models for text-to-image synthesis task are still under-developed.
In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG, a unified generative pre-training
framework for bidirectional image-text generation with transformer model. Based
on the image quantization models, we formulate both image generation and text
generation as autoregressive generative tasks conditioned on the text/image
input. The bidirectional image-text generative modeling eases the semantic
alignments across vision and language. For the text-to-image generation
process, we further propose an end-to-end training method to jointly learn the
visual sequence generator and the image reconstructor. To explore the landscape
of large-scale pre-training for bidirectional text-image generation, we train a
10-billion parameter ERNIE-ViLG model on a large-scale dataset of 145 million
(Chinese) image-text pairs which achieves state-of-the-art performance for both
text-to-image and image-to-text tasks, obtaining an FID of 7.9 on MS-COCO for
text-to-image synthesis and best results on COCO-CN and AIC-ICC for image
captioning.","['cs.CV', 'cs.CL']",2021-12-30,"['Han Zhang', 'Weichong Yin', 'Yewei Fang', 'Lanxin Li', 'Boqiang Duan', 'Zhihua Wu', 'Yu Sun', 'Hao Tian', 'Hua Wu', 'Haifeng Wang']"
186,Energy-Aware Multi-Robot Task Allocation in Persistent Tasks,"The applicability of the swarm robots to perform foraging tasks is inspired
by their compact size and cost. A considerable amount of energy is required to
perform such tasks, especially if the tasks are continuous and/or repetitive.
Real-world situations in which robots perform tasks continuously while staying
alive (survivability) and maximizing production (performance) require energy
awareness. This paper proposes an energy-conscious distributed task allocation
algorithm to solve continuous tasks (e.g., unlimited foraging) for cooperative
robots to achieve highly effective missions. We consider efficiency as a
function of the energy consumed by the robot during exploration and collection
when food is returned to the collection bin. Finally, the proposed
energy-efficient algorithm minimizes the total transit time to the charging
station and time consumed while recharging and maximizes the robot's lifetime
to perform maximum tasks to enhance the overall efficiency of collaborative
robots. We evaluated the proposed solution against a typical greedy
benchmarking strategy (assigning the closest collection bin to the available
robot and recharging the robot at maximum) for efficiency and performance in
various scenarios. The proposed approach significantly improved performance and
efficiency over the baseline approach.",['cs.RO'],2021-12-30,"['Ehsan Latif', 'Yikang Gui', 'Aiman Munir', 'Ramviyas Parasuraman']"
187,"Digital Rock Typing DRT Algorithm Formulation with Optimal Supervised
  Semantic Segmentation","Each grid block in a 3D geological model requires a rock type that represents
all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that
classify rock types are lithology, permeability, and capillary pressure.
Scientists and engineers determined these properties using conventional
laboratory measurements, which embedded destructive methods to the sample or
altered some of its properties (i.e., wettability, permeability, and porosity)
because the measurements process includes sample crushing, fluid flow, or fluid
saturation. Lately, Digital Rock Physics (DRT) has emerged to quantify these
properties from micro-Computerized Tomography (uCT) and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images. However, the literature did not attempt rock typing in a
wholly digital context. We propose performing Digital Rock Typing (DRT) by: (1)
integrating the latest DRP advances in a novel process that honors digital rock
properties determination, while; (2) digitalizing the latest rock typing
approaches in carbonate, and (3) introducing a novel carbonate rock typing
process that utilizes computer vision capabilities to provide more insight
about the heterogeneous carbonate rock texture.","['cs.LG', 'astro-ph.EP', 'cs.CV', 'physics.geo-ph']",2021-12-30,"['Omar Alfarisi', 'Djamel Ouzzane', 'Mohamed Sassi', 'Tiejun Zhang']"
188,"Elimination (a,b)-trees with fast, durable updates","Many concurrent dictionary implementations are designed and optimized for
read-mostly workloads with uniformly distributed keys, and often perform poorly
on update-heavy workloads. In this work, we first present a concurrent
(a,b)-tree, the OCC-ABtree, which outperforms its fastest competitor by up to
2x on uniform update-heavy workloads, and is competitive on other workloads. We
then turn our attention to skewed update-heavy workloads (which feature many
inserts/deletes on the same key) and introduce the Elim-ABtree, which uses a
new optimization called publishing elimination. In publishing elimination,
concurrent inserts and deletes to a key are reordered to eliminate them. This
reduces the number of writes in the data structure. The Elim-ABtree achieves up
to 2.5x the performance of its fastest competitor (including the OCC-ABtree).
The OCC-ABtree and Elim-ABtree are linearizable. We also introduce durable

identify a fragment of MLL1, which seems sufficient for many grammar

190,Benign Overfitting in Adversarially Robust Linear Classification,"""Benign overfitting"", where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-30,"['Jinghui Chen', 'Yuan Cao', 'Quanquan Gu']"
191,"An Efficient Federated Distillation Learning System for Multi-task Time
  Series Classification","This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system
(EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a
central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run
different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based
student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)
scheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its
teacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge
distillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.
For each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are
uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the
server, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between
the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected
user such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all
the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its
partner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to
their teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed
EFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets

193,Delving into Sample Loss Curve to Embrace Noisy and Imbalanced Data,"Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically
collected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural
networks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a
sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing
weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing
only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with
corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How
to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this
paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar
transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,
which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by
this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate
training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole
biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each
sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the
resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named
CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper
weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning
also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer
meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom
layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed
method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'cs.CV']",2021-12-30,"['Shenwang Jiang', 'Jianan Li', 'Ying Wang', 'Bo Huang', 'Zhang Zhang', 'Tingfa Xu']"
194,"A Lightweight and Accurate Spatial-Temporal Transformer for Traffic
  Forecasting","We study the forecasting problem for traffic with dynamic, possibly
periodical, and joint spatial-temporal dependency between regions. Given the
aggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to
t-1, we predict the traffic at time t at any region. Prior arts in the area
often consider the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner or
are rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of
hyper-parameters to tune. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight, and accurate
Spatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for
traffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information
fusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex
spatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to
improve the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation
complexity for dependency learning from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\sqrt{n})$, where n is
the number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,
the offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning
and computation (with a reduction of up to $90\%$ on training time and network
parameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments
show that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than
state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to $9.5\%$ on
RMSE, and $12.4\%$ on MAPE).","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",2021-12-30,"['Guanyao Li', 'Shuhan Zhong', 'Letian Xiang', 'S. -H. Gary Chan', 'Ruiyuan Li', 'Chih-Chieh Hung', 'Wen-Chih Peng']"

for traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, most studies pay attention to the
neural network design and rarely concentrate on the state representation. Does
the design of state representation has a good impact on TSC? In this paper, we
(1) propose an effective state representation as queue length of vehicles with
intensive knowledge; (2) present a TSC method called MaxQueue based on our
state representation approach; (3) develop a general RL-based TSC template
called QL-XLight with queue length as state and reward and generate QL-FRAP,
QL-CoLight, and QL-DQN by our QL-XLight template based on traditional and
latest RL models.Through comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that: (1) our MaxQueue method outperforms the latest
RL based methods; (2) QL-FRAP and QL-CoLight achieves a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In general, state representation with intensive knowledge is also

a single reward model, thus rendering it difficult to trade off different

Active Learning (MORAL), a novel method for combining diverse demonstrations of
social norms into a Pareto-optimal policy. Through maintaining a distribution
over scalarization weights, our approach is able to interactively tune a deep
RL agent towards a variety of preferences, while eliminating the need for
computing multiple policies. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
MORAL in two scenarios, which model a delivery and an emergency task that
require an agent to act in the presence of normative conflicts. Overall, we
consider our research a step towards multi-objective RL with learned rewards,
bridging the gap between current reward learning and machine ethics literature.","['cs.LG', 'cs.AI']",2021-12-30,"['Markus Peschl', 'Arkady Zgonnikov', 'Frans A. Oliehoek', 'Luciano C. Siebert']"

  Unitary Approximate Message Passing","Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is very promising for wireless
networks to achieve high energy efficiency, extended coverage, improved
capacity, massive connectivity, etc. To unleash the full potentials of
RIS-aided communications, acquiring accurate channel state information is
crucial, which however is very challenging. For RIS-aided multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) communications, the existing channel estimation methods
have computational complexity growing rapidly with the number of RIS units $N$
(e.g., in the order of $N^2$ or $N^3$) and/or have special requirements on the
matrices involved (e.g., the matrices need to be sparse for algorithm
convergence to achieve satisfactory performance), which hinder their
applications. In this work, instead of using the conventional signal model in
the literature, we derive a new signal model obtained through proper
vectorization and reduction operations. Then, leveraging the unitary
approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop a more efficient channel
estimator that has complexity linear with $N$ and does not have special
requirements on the relevant matrices, thanks to the robustness of UAMP. These
facilitate the applications of the proposed algorithm to a general RIS-aided
MIMO system with a larger $N$. Moreover, extensive numerical results show that
the proposed estimator delivers much better performance and/or requires
significantly less number of training symbols, thereby leading to notable
reductions in both training overhead and latency.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-30,"['Yabo Guo', 'Peng Sun', 'Zhengdao Yuan', 'Chongwen Huang', 'Qinghua Guo', 'Zhongyong Wang', 'Chau Yuen']"
