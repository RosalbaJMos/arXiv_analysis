0,"Proofs of Chappelon and Alfons\'{\i}n Conjectures On Square Frobenius
  Numbers and its Relationship to Simultaneous Pell's Equations","Recently, Chappelon and Alfons\'{\i}n defined the square Frobenius number of
coprime numbers $m$ and $n$ to be the largest perfect square that cannot be
expressed in the form $mx+ny$ for nonnegative integers $x$ and $y$. When $m$
and $n$ differ by $1$ or $2$, they found simple expressions if neither $m$ nor
$n$ is a perfect square. If either $m$ or $n$ is a perfect square, they
formulated some interesting conjectures which have an unexpected close
connection with a known recursive sequence, related to the denominators of
Farey fraction approximations to $\sqrt{2}$. In this note, we prove these
conjectures. Our methods involve solving Pell's equations $x^2-2y^2=1$ and
$x^2-2y^2=-1$. Finally, to complete our proofs of these conjectures, we
eliminate several cases using a bunch of results related to solutions of
simultaneous Pell's equations.",['math.NT'],2021-12-31,['Damanvir Singh Binner']
1,Causal Network Condensation,"In this paper, we introduce a generalized topological quantum field theory
based on the symmetric monoidal category which we call causal network
condensation since it can be regarded as a generalization of spin network
construction of Baez, Turaev-Viro model and causal set theory. In this paper we
introduce some new concepts, including causal network category, causal network
diagrams, and their gauge transformations. Based on these concepts, we
introduce the nerve functor for the symmetric monoidal category. It can be
regarded as a generalization of the nerve functor for simplicial category.","['math.CT', 'hep-th', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']",2021-12-31,"['Xuexing Lu', 'Ziqian Tang']"
2,"Human and Machine Type Communications can Coexist in Uplink Massive MIMO
  Systems","Future cellular networks are expected to support new communication paradigms
such as machine-type communication (MTC) services along with human-type
communication (HTC) services. This requires base stations to serve a large
number of devices in relatively short channel coherence intervals which renders
allocation of orthogonal pilot sequence per-device approaches impractical.
Furthermore, the stringent power constraints, place-and-play type connectivity
and various data rate requirements of MTC devices make it impossible for the
traditional cellular architecture to accommodate MTC and HTC services together.
Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MaMIMO) technology has the potential to
allow the coexistence of HTC and MTC services, thanks to its inherent spatial
multiplexing properties and low transmission power requirements. In this work,
we investigate the performance of a single cell under a shared physical channel
assumption for MTC and HTC services and propose a novel scheme for sharing the
time-frequency resources. The analysis reveals that MaMIMO can significantly
enhance the performance of such a setup and allow the inclusion of MTC services
into the cellular networks without requiring additional resources.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-31,"['Kamil Senel', 'Emil Björnson', 'Erik G. Larsson']"

NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) and standard massive MIMO (multiple-input

outperforms NOMA in i.i.d.~Rayleigh fading channels, if a sufficient number of
antennas are used at the base stations. The simulation results show that the
crossing point occurs already when having 20-30 antennas, which is far less

5,Semi unbounded order convergent in ordered vector spaces,"Let $X$ be an ordered vector space. The net $\{x_\alpha\}\subseteq X$ is semi
unbounded order convergent to $x$ (in symbol $x_\alpha\xrightarrow{suo}x$), if
there is a net $\{y_\beta\}$, possibly over a different index set, such that
$y_\beta \downarrow 0$ and for every $\beta$ there exists $\alpha_0$ such that
$\{\{\pm(x_\alpha - x)\}^u,y\}^l\subseteq \{y_\beta\}^l$, whenever $\alpha \geq
\alpha_0$ and for all $0\leq y \in X$. In vector lattice $E$, semi unbounded

6,"Log determinant of large correlation matrices under infinite fourth
  moment","In this paper, we show the central limit theorem for the logarithmic
determinant of the sample correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ constructed from the
$(p\times n)$-dimensional data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ containing independent and
identically distributed random entries with mean zero, variance one and
infinite fourth moments. Precisely, we show that for $p/n\to \gamma\in (0,1)$
as $n,p\to \infty$ the logarithmic law \begin{equation*} \frac{\log \det
\mathbf{R} -(p-n+\frac{1}{2})\log(1-p/n)+p-p/n}{\sqrt{-2\log(1-p/n)- 2 p/n}}
\overset{d}{\rightarrow} N(0,1)\, \end{equation*} is still valid if the entries
of the data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ follow a symmetric distribution with a
regularly varying tail of index $\alpha\in (3,4)$. The latter assumptions seem
to be crucial, which is justified by the simulations: if the entries of
$\mathbf{X}$ have the infinite absolute third moment and/or their distribution
is not symmetric, the logarithmic law is not valid anymore. The derived results
highlight that the logarithmic determinant of the sample correlation matrix is
a very stable and flexible statistic for heavy-tailed big data and open a novel
way of analysis of high-dimensional random matrices with self-normalized
entries.",['math.PR'],2021-12-31,"['Johannes Heiny', 'Nestor Parolya']"

and higher, corresponding to the mass supercritical case. We construct
rigorously a solution which blows up in finite time by having its mass
concentrating near a ring that shrinks to a point. In particular, the
singularity is of type II, non self-similar. We show the stability of this
dynamics among spherically symmetric solutions. In renormalised variables, the
solution ressembles a traveling wave imploding at the origin, and this, to our
knowledge, is the first stability result for such phenomenon for an evolution
PDE. We develop a framework to handle the interactions between the two blowup
zones contributing to the mechanism: a thin inner zone around the ring where
viscosity effects occur, and an outer zone where the evolution is mostly

Nevertheless, for systems with continuum symmetry, e.g., electronic insulators,
it is still unclear how to construct an exactly solvable model with a finite

construction and classification for 2D interacting electronic insulators. Based
on the physical picture of $\mathrm{U(1)}_f$-charge decorations, we illustrate
the key idea by considering the well known 2D interacting topological
insulator. Then we generalize our construction to an arbitrary 2D interacting
electronic insulator with symmetry $G_f=\mathrm{U(1)}_f
\rtimes_{\rho_1,\omega_2} G$, where $\mathrm{U(1)}_f$ is the charge
conservation symmetry and $\rho_1, \omega_2$ are additional data which fully
characterize the group structure of $G_f$. Finally we study more examples,

weighted sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the unicast user terminals (UTs) and
for the multicast transmission the objective is to maximize the minimum SE of
the multicast UTs. These two problems are coupled to each other in a
conflicting manner, due to their shared power resource and interference. To
address this, we formulate a multiobjective optimization problem (MOOP). We
derive the Pareto boundary of the MOOP analytically and determine the values of
the system parameters to achieve any desired Pareto optimal point. Moreover, we
prove that the Pareto region is convex, hence the system should serve the

21,"Channel Estimation for Hybrid Massive MIMO Systems with
  Adaptive-Resolution ADCs","Achieving high channel estimation accuracy and reducing hardware cost as well
as power dissipation constitute substantial challenges in the design of massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To resolve these difficulties,
sophisticated pilot designs have been conceived for the family of
energy-efficient hybrid analog-digital (HAD) beamforming architecture relying
on adaptive-resolution analog-to-digital converters (RADCs). In this paper, we
jointly optimize the pilot sequences, the number of RADC quantization bits and
the hybrid receiver combiner in the uplink of multiuser massive MIMO systems.
We solve the associated mean square error (MSE) minimization problem of channel
estimation in the context of correlated Rayleigh fading channels subject to
practical constraints. The associated mixed-integer problem is quite
challenging due to the nonconvex nature of the objective function and of the
constraints. By relying on advanced fractional programming (FP) techniques, we
first recast the original problem into a more tractable yet equivalent form,
which allows the decoupling of the fractional objective function. We then
conceive a pair of novel algorithms for solving the resultant problems for
codebook-based and codebook-free pilot schemes, respectively. To reduce the
design complexity, we also propose a simplified algorithm for the
codebook-based pilot scheme. Our simulation results confirm the superiority of
the proposed algorithms over the relevant state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-31,"['Yalin Wang', 'Xihan Chen', 'Yunlong Cai', 'Benoit Champagne', 'Lajos Hanzo']"

restrictions on the frame $\{ f_k \}_{k=1}^\infty$. The purpose of the paper is
to present an overview of the results in the literature and also discuss
various alternative ways of representing a frame; in particular the class of
considered frames can be enlarged drastically by allowing representations using
only a subset $\{ T^{\alpha(k)} \varphi\}^\infty_{k=1}$ of the operator orbit

  We adopt the apprenticeship learning formalism, which carries the assumption
that the true cost function can be represented as a linear combination of some

strong theoretical guarantees, but are computationally expensive because they
use reinforcement learning or planning algorithms as a subroutine. On the other

benchmark tasks, but are not well understood in terms of theory. With an
emphasis on non-asymptotic guarantees of performance, we propose a method that
directly learns a policy from expert demonstrations, bypassing the intermediate
step of learning the cost function, by formulating the problem as a single
convex optimization problem over occupancy measures. We develop a

consist of linear combinations of $n$-webs with ends in $\mathcal N$,
considered up to skein relations inspired by the relations of the
Reshetikhin-Turaev theory.
  We prove that cutting $M$ along a disk resulting in a $3$-manifold $M'$
yields a homomorphism $S_n(M)\to S_n(M')$. That result allows to analyze the
skein modules of $3$-manifolds through the skein modules of their pieces.
  The theory of stated skein modules is particularly rich for thickened
surfaces $M=\Sigma \times (-1,1),$ in whose case, $S_n(M)$ is an algebra,
denoted by $S_n(\Sigma).$ We prove that the skein algebra of the ideal bigon is
$O_q(SL(n))$ and that it provides simple geometric interpretations of the
product, coproduct, counit, the antipode, and the cobraided structure on
$O_q(SL(n)).$
  Additionally, we show that a splitting of a thickened bigon near a marking
defines a $O_q(SL(n))$-comodule structure on $S_n(M),$ or dually, an
$U_q(sl_n)$-module structure. Furthermore, we show that the skein algebra of
surfaces $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$ glued along two sides of a triangle is isomorphic
with the braided tensor product $S_n(\Sigma_1)\underline{\otimes}
S_n(\Sigma_2)$ of Majid. These results allow for a geometric interpretation of
further concepts in the theory of quantum groups, for example, of the braided
products and of Majid's transmutation operation.

$Rep\, U_q(sl_n)$ is equivalent to the category of left modules over
$S_n(\Sigma)$. We also discuss the relation with the quantum moduli spaces of

the meaning of language and text, and home number experiences. The children's
language abilities (phonological awareness and vocabulary) and nonverbal
abilities (inhibitory control and nonverbal reasoning) were assessed in the
final term of preschool (Mage=4:3). Their number skills were reassessed in the
final term of the first year of primary school (Mage=5:3). Home letter-sound
interaction experiences (interactive code-focused literacy experiences) had
significant longitudinal relationships with counting and number transcoding
that were independent of language and nonverbal abilities. The relationship
between letter-sound interaction experiences and later counting was also
independent of the autoregressive influence of baseline counting ability. We
extend previous findings by demonstrating that interactive code-focused home
literacy experiences in the preschool period predict growth in counting skills

First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some
predictor must be able to simultaneously minimize the source and target risk.
Second, the representation's marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised learning
methods that only use unlabelled data and augmentations to train robust
representations. Our objectives achieve state-of-the-art results on DomainBed,

mechanical system with symmetry representing the motion of two interacting
scalar particles on a manifold, which is the product of the total space of the

The factorization of the measure in the path integral, which is necessary for
the reduction, was based on the application of a nonlinear filtration equation

33,Non Abelian dual of the resolved conifold gauged linear sigma model,"We consider a U(1) Gauged Linear Sigma Model (GLSM) with (2,2) supersymmetry,
leading to a susy vacua of the resolved conifold. It possesses the non-Abelian
global symmetry SU(2)xSU(2). A non-Abelian T-duality can be constructed which
can be described by gauging the global non-Abelian symmetry. This leads to a
dual action, in terms of the dual model Kaehler and superpotential terms, which
include twisted chiral superfields dependence. Comparing the effective
potentials for the U(1) fields on the original and the dual models we determine
the instanton corrections to the dual action. We obtain the supersymmetry vacua
solution of the dual model, in three cases: first in an Abelian direction
inside SU(2)xSU(2), then for an Abelian direction considering instanton
corrections and finally for a semi-chiral non Abelian vector superfield. The
dual geometry for all of these cases (SUSY vacua space) is given by T5xR.
However the instanton corrections restrict the Fayet-Iliopoulos term to be zero
and fix the theta-term, which implies that the duality is established for the
case of the singular conifold. We also discuss the U(1)A R-symmetry in the dual

34,"Large-scale focusing joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data with
  Gramian constraint","A fast algorithm for the large-scale joint inversion of gravity and magnetic
data is developed. It uses a nonlinear Gramian constraint to impose correlation
between density and susceptibility of reconstructed models. The global
objective function is formulated in the space of the weighted parameters, but
the Gramian constraint is implemented in the original space, and the nonlinear
constraint is imposed using two separate Lagrange parameters, one for each
model domain. This combined approach provides more similarity between the
reconstructed models. It is assumed that the measured data are obtained on a
uniform grid and that a consistent regular discretization of the volume domain
is imposed. The sensitivity matrices exhibit a block Toeplitz Toeplitz block
structure for each depth layer of the model domain. Forward and transpose
operations with the matrices can be implemented efficiently using two
dimensional fast Fourier transforms. This makes it feasible to solve for large
scale problems with respect to both computational costs and memory demands, and
to solve the nonlinear problem by applying iterative methods that rely only on
matrix vector multiplications. As such, the use of the regularized reweighted
conjugate gradient algorithm, in conjunction with the structure of the
sensitivity matrices, leads to a fast methodology for large-scale joint
inversion of geophysical data sets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that it
is possible to apply a nonlinear joint inversion algorithm, with $L_p$-norm
stabilisers, for the reconstruction of large model domains on a standard laptop
computer. It is demonstrated, that the p=1 choice provides sparse reconstructed
solutions with sharp boundaries, and $p=2$ provides smooth and blurred models.

Furthermore, the factor is fully characterized as a functional of $F$. We also

43,Nonlinear Classical and Quantum Integrable Systems with PT-symmetries,"A key feature of integrable systems is that they can be solved to obtain
exact analytical solutions. We show how new models can be constructed through
generalisations of some well known nonlinear partial differential equations
with PT-symmetries whilst preserving integrability. Subsequently, we develop
new methods from well-known ones to obtain exact analytical soliton solutions
for these new systems. The first PT-symmetric generalization we take are
extensions to the complex and multicomplex fields. In agreement with the
reality property present in PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum systems, we find
PT-symmetries also play a key role in the reality of conserved charges here. We
then extend our investigations to explore degenerate multi-soliton solutions
for the sine-Gordon and Hirota equations. In particular, we find the usual
time-delays from degenerate soliton solution scattering are time-dependent,
unlike the non-degenerate multi-soliton solutions, and provide a universal
formula to compute the exact time-delay values for the scattering of N-soliton
solutions. Other PT-symmetric extensions of integrable systems we take are of
nonlocal nature, with nonlocalities in space and/or in time, of time crystal
type. Whilst developing new methods for the construction of soliton solutions
for these systems, we find new types of solutions with different parameter
dependence and qualitative behaviour even in the one-soliton solution cases. We
exploit gauge equivalence between the Hirota system with continuous Heisenberg
and Landau-Lifschitz systems to see how nonlocality is inherited from one
system to another and vice versa. Extending investigations to the quantum
regime, we generalize the scheme of Darboux transformations for fully
time-dependent non-Hermitian quantum systems, which allows us to create an

successive iteration i, and characterize the values of p where the maxima of

widely studied model for nonlinear acoustics (NLA): a third--order (in time)
semilinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) with the distinctive feature of
predicting the propagation of ultrasound waves at \textit{finite} speed due to
heat phenomenon know as \textit{second sound} which leads to the hyperbolic
character of heat propagation. In practice, the JMGT dynamics is largely used
for modeling the evolution of the acoustic velocity and, most importantly, the
acoustic pressure as sound waves propagate through certain media. %Due to its
sensitivity to different media, such model (or similar) is often used for

cannot be relied upon for stabilization purposes. In this paper the issue of
boundary stabilizability of originally unstable (JMGT) equation is resolved.
Motivated by modeling aspects in HIFU technology, boundary feedback is
supported only on a portion of the boundary, while the remaining part of the

63,"High-Order Statistical Functional Expansion and Its Application To Some
  Nonsmooth Problems","Let $\bx_j = \btheta +\bep_j, j=1,...,n$, be observations of an unknown
parameter $\btheta$ in a Euclidean or separable Hilbert space $\scrH$, where
$\bep_j$ are noises as random elements in $\scrH$ from a general distribution.
We study the estimation of $f(\btheta)$ for a given functional
$f:\scrH\rightarrow \RR$ based on $\bx_j$'s. The key element of our approach is
a new method which we call High-Order Degenerate Statistical Expansion. It
leverages the use of classical multivariate Taylor expansion and degenerate
$U$-statistic and yields an elegant explicit formula. In the univariate case of
$\scrH=\R$, the formula expresses the error of the proposed estimator as a sum
of order $k$ degenerate $U$-products of the noises with coefficient
$f^{(k)}(\btheta)/k!$ and an explicit remainder term in the form of the
Riemann-Liouville integral as in the Taylor expansion around the true
$\btheta$. For general $\scrH$, the formula expresses the estimation error in
terms of the inner product of $f^{(k)}(\btheta)/k!$ and the average of the
tensor products of $k$ noises with distinct indices and a parallel extension of
the remainder term from the univariate case. This makes the proposed method a
natural statistical version of the classical Taylor expansion. The proposed
estimator can be viewed as a jackknife estimator of an ideal degenerate
expansion of $f(\cdot)$ around the true $\btheta$ with the degenerate
$U$-product of the noises, and can be approximated by bootstrap. Thus, the
jackknife, bootstrap and Taylor expansion approaches all converge to the
proposed estimator. We develop risk bounds for the proposed estimator and a
central limit theorem under a second moment condition (even in expansions of
higher than the second order). We apply this new method to generalize several
existing results with smooth and nonsmooth $f$ to universal $\bep_j$'s with
only minimum moment constraints.","['math.ST', 'stat.TH']",2021-12-31,"['Fan Zhou', 'Ping Li', 'Cun-Hui Zhang']"

example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.","['cs.LG', 'math.OC', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-31,"['Raul Astudillo', 'Peter I. Frazier']"

paper investigates massive grant-free access in a wideband system under
frequency-selective fading. First, we present an orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM)-based massive grant-free access scheme. Then, we propose
two different but equivalent models for the received pilot signal, which are
essential for designing various device activity detection and channel
estimation methods for OFDM-based massive grant-free access. One directly
models the received signal for actual devices, whereas the other can be
interpreted as a signal model for virtual devices. Next, we investigate
statistical device activity detection under frequency-selective Rayleigh fading
based on the two signal models. We first model device activities as unknown
deterministic quantities and propose three maximum likelihood (ML)
estimation-based device activity detection methods with different detection
accuracies and computation times. We also model device activities as random
variables with a known joint distribution and propose three maximum a posterior
probability (MAP) estimation-based device activity methods, which further
enhance the accuracies of the corresponding ML estimation-based methods.
Optimization techniques and matrix analysis are applied in designing and

reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent, and
2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring performance improvement).
As an example, we construct a sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP
(SS-BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if its state evolution has a unique fixed
point. In addition, the mean square error (MSE) of SS-BO-MAMP is not worse than
the original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity

the many-to-many version of SMP, we introduce a new representation of SMP as an
extended bipartite graph and reduce the problem to submodular minimization. It
is a natural problem to establish computational complexity of deciding whether
at most $k$ swaps are enough to turn $I$ into an instance where one of the
maximum matchings is stable. Using a hardness result of Gupta et al. (2020), we
prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether at most $k$ swaps are enough to turn

96,"Kernel Two-Sample Tests in High Dimension: Interplay Between Moment
  Discrepancy and Dimension-and-Sample Orders","Motivated by the increasing use of kernel-based metrics for high-dimensional
and large-scale data, we study the asymptotic behavior of kernel two-sample
tests when the dimension and sample sizes both diverge to infinity. We focus on
the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with the kernel of the form
$k(x,y)=f(\|x-y\|_{2}^{2}/\gamma)$, including MMD with the Gaussian kernel and
the Laplacian kernel, and the energy distance as special cases. We derive
asymptotic expansions of the kernel two-sample statistics, based on which we
establish the central limit theorem (CLT) under both the null hypothesis and
the local and fixed alternatives. The new non-null CLT results allow us to
perform asymptotic exact power analysis, which reveals a delicate interplay
between the moment discrepancy that can be detected by the kernel two-sample
tests and the dimension-and-sample orders. The asymptotic theory is further
corroborated through numerical studies. Our findings complement those in the
recent literature and shed new light on the use of kernel two-sample tests for
high-dimensional and large-scale data.","['math.ST', 'stat.ML', 'stat.TH']",2021-12-31,"['Jian Yan', 'Xianyang Zhang']"
97,"Centralized and Distributed Power Allocation for Max-Min Fairness in
  Cell-Free Massive MIMO","Cell-free Massive MIMO systems consist of a large number of geographically
distributed access points (APs) that serve users by coherent joint
transmission. Downlink power allocation is important in these systems, to
determine which APs should transmit to which users and with what power. If the
system is implemented correctly, it can deliver a more uniform user performance
than conventional cellular networks. To this end, previous works have shown how
to perform system-wide max-min fairness power allocation when using maximum
ratio precoding. In this paper, we first generalize this method to arbitrary
precoding, and then train a neural network to perform approximately the same
power allocation but with reduced computational complexity. Finally, we train
one neural network per AP to mimic system-wide max-min fairness power
allocation, but using only local information. By learning the structure of the
local propagation environment, this method outperforms the state-of-the-art
distributed power allocation method from the Cell-free Massive MIMO literature.","['cs.IT', 'eess.SP', 'math.IT']",2021-12-31,"['Sucharita Chakraborty', 'Emil Björnson', 'Luca Sanguinetti']"

  Numerical solution and solitary waves","In this paper we study some theoretical and numerical issues of the
Boussinesq/Full dispersion system. This is a a three-parameter system of pde's
that models the propagation of internal waves along the interface of two-fluid
layers with rigid lid condition for the upper layer, and under a Boussinesq
regime for the upper layer and a full dispersion regime for the lower layer. We
first discretize in space the periodic initial-value problem with a
Fourier-Galerkin spectral method and prove error estimates for several ranges
of values of the parameters. Solitary waves of the model systems are then
studied numerically in several ways. The numerical generation is analyzed by
approximating the ode system with periodic boundary conditions for the
solitary-wave profiles with a Fourier spectral scheme, implemented in a
collocation form, and solving iteratively the corresponding algebraic system in
Fourier space with the Petviashvili method accelerated with the minimal
polynomial extrapolation technique. Motivated by the numerical results, a new
result of existence of solitary waves is proved. In the last part of the paper,
the dynamics of these solitary waves is studied computationally, To this end,
the semidiscrete systems obtained from the Fourier-Galerkin discretization in
space are integrated numerically in time by a Runge-Kutta Composition method of
order four. The fully discrete scheme is used to explore numerically the
stability of solitary waves, their collisions, and the resolution of other

relation, whose set of solutions is called the curvature diagram or the
W-diagram of the surface. Making use of the notion of geometric linear momentum
of a plane curve, we propose a new approach to the study of rotational
Weingarten surfaces in Euclidean 3-space. Our contribution consists of reducing
any type of Weingarten condition on a rotational surface to a first order
differential equation on the momentum of the generatrix curve. In this line, we
provide two new classification results involving a cubic and an hyperbola in
the W-diagram of the surface characterizing, respectively, the non-degenerated
quadric surfaces of revolution and the elasticoids, defined as the rotational
surfaces generated by the rotation of the Euler elastic curves around their
directrix line.
  As another application of our approach, we deal with the problem of
prescribing mean or Gauss curvature on rotational surfaces in terms of
arbitrary continuous functions depending on distance from the surface to the
axis of revolution. As a consequence, we provide simple new proofs of some

107,The validity of bootstrap testing in the threshold framework,"We consider bootstrap-based testing for threshold effects in non-linear
threshold autoregressive (TAR) models. It is well-known that classic tests
based on asymptotic theory tend to be oversized in the case of small, or even
moderate sample sizes, or when the estimated parameters indicate
non-stationarity, as often witnessed in the analysis of financial or climate
data. To address the issue we propose a supremum Lagrange Multiplier test
statistic (sLMb), where the null hypothesis specifies a linear autoregressive
(AR) model against the alternative of a TAR model. We consider a recursive
bootstrap applied to the sLMb statistic and establish its validity. This result
is new, and requires the proof of non-standard results for bootstrap analysis
in time series models; this includes a uniform bootstrap law of large numbers
and a bootstrap functional central limit theorem. These new results can also be
used as a general theoretical framework that can be adapted to other
situations, such as regime-switching processes with exogenous threshold
variables, or testing for structural breaks. The Monte Carlo evidence shows
that the bootstrap test has correct empirical size even for small samples, and
also no loss of empirical power when compared to the asymptotic test. Moreover,
its performance is not affected if the order of the autoregression is estimated
based on information criteria. Finally, we analyse a panel of short time series

For the rescaled equations, we prove that the steady flow (Taylor-Couette flow)

the original 2D Navier-Stokes equations, this implies an improved transition
threshold for the Taylor-Couette flow. The improvement is due to enhanced
dissipation and new observations and constructions of weighted $L^2$ norms,
which capture a hidden structure between the viscosity constant $\nu$ and
(different) rotating speeds and locations of two coaxial cylinders. In
particular, we allow the location of the outer cylinder to tend to infinity,
which renders the initial fluid kinetic energy not uniformly bounded. Due to
enhanced-dissipation effect, we also establish a sharp resolvent estimate,
desired space-time bounds and optimal decaying estimates, which lead to the

essential to predict the various geomechanical process such as CO2

interest, for instance, that include fracturing or damage of the solid phase,
require a nonlinear description of the large deformations that can occur. This
paper presents a variational energy-based continuum mechanics framework to
model large-deformation poroelasticity. The approach begins from the total free
energy density that is additively composed of the free energy of the
components. A variational procedure then provides the balance of momentum,
fluid transport balance, and pressure relations. A numerical approach based on
finite elements is applied to analyze the behavior of saturated and unsaturated
porous media using a nonlinear constitutive model for the solid skeleton.
Examples studied include the Terzaghi and Mandel problems; a gas-liquid
phase-changing fluid; multiple immiscible gases; and unsaturated systems where
we model injection of fluid into soil. The proposed variational approach can
potentially have advantages for numerical methods as well as for combining with
data-driven models in a Bayesian framework.","['math.AP', 'cond-mat.soft']",2021-12-30,"['Mina Karimi', 'Mehrdad Massoudi', 'Noel Walkington', 'Matteo Pozzi', 'Kaushik Dayal']"

117,"Studying the Interplay between Information Loss and Operation Loss in
  Representations for Classification","Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.","['cs.LG', 'cs.IT', 'math.IT', 'stat.ML']",2021-12-30,"['Jorge F. Silva', 'Felipe Tobar', 'Mario Vicuña', 'Felipe Cordova']"

Einstein field equations with a perfect fluid source are constructed. The
solutions are obtained by matching a self-similar perturbation of a
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime to a self-similar static
spacetime across a spherical shock surface. These shock wave solutions model a
general relativistic explosion within a static isothermal sphere and extend the
one parameter family of general relativistic shock waves constructed by Smoller
and Temple. Such an extension partially resolves a long standing problem posed
by Cahill and Taub by determining a subset of the self-similar spacetimes that
may be matched to a self-similar static spacetime to form a general
relativistic shock wave. The original problem is posed for a pure radiation
equation of state, however the shock waves that are constructed resolve the
problem for general barotropic equations of state either side of the shock.
These shock waves are stable in the Lax sense and a formal existence proof is
provided in the pure radiation case, as self-similar perturbations of FLRW
spacetimes are not known explicitly. These spacetimes are of particular
interest as they have an accelerated expansion similar to the accelerated
expansion found in the Standard Model of Cosmology, but solve the Einstein
field equations in the absence of a cosmological constant. It is conjectured by
Temple that a vast primordial shock wave, with a perturbed FLRW interior, could

architecture that accepts persistence diagrams as input. The Persformer
architecture significantly outperforms previous topological neural network
architectures on classical synthetic benchmark datasets. Moreover, it satisfies

networks to achieve high energy efficiency, extended coverage, improved
capacity, massive connectivity, etc. To unleash the full potentials of
RIS-aided communications, acquiring accurate channel state information is
crucial, which however is very challenging. For RIS-aided multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) communications, the existing channel estimation methods
have computational complexity growing rapidly with the number of RIS units $N$
(e.g., in the order of $N^2$ or $N^3$) and/or have special requirements on the
matrices involved (e.g., the matrices need to be sparse for algorithm
convergence to achieve satisfactory performance), which hinder their
applications. In this work, instead of using the conventional signal model in
the literature, we derive a new signal model obtained through proper
vectorization and reduction operations. Then, leveraging the unitary
approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop a more efficient channel
estimator that has complexity linear with $N$ and does not have special
requirements on the relevant matrices, thanks to the robustness of UAMP. These
facilitate the applications of the proposed algorithm to a general RIS-aided
MIMO system with a larger $N$. Moreover, extensive numerical results show that

combines the classical distributed gradient descent (DGD) method and Random
Reshuffling (RR). We show that D-RR inherits the superiority of RR for both

for smooth strongly convex objective functions, D-RR achieves
$\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$ rate of convergence (here, $T$ counts the total number of
iterations) in terms of the squared distance between the iterate and the unique
minimizer. When the objective function is assumed to be smooth nonconvex and
has Lipschitz continuous component functions, we show that D-RR drives the

convergence results match those of centralized RR (up to constant factors).","['math.OC', 'cs.DC', 'cs.LG', 'cs.MA']",2021-12-30,"['Kun Huang', 'Xiao Li', 'Andre Milzarek', 'Shi Pu', 'Junwen Qiu']"

in optimal control and the discrete adjoint system, Numer. Math.,2000, pp.
247-282], direct approach with RK discretization is equivalent with indirect
approach based on symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta (SPRK) integration. In
this paper, we will reconstruct this equivalence by the analogue of continuous
and discrete dynamic programming. Then, based on the equivalence, we discuss
the issue that the internal-stage controls produced by direct approach may have
lower order accuracy than the RK method used. We propose order conditions for
internal-stage controls and then demonstrate that third or fourth order
explicit RK discretization cannot avoid the order reduction phenomenon. To
overcome this obstacle, we calculate node control instead of internal-stage
controls in DLQR and ILQR methods. And numerical examples will illustrate the
validity of our methods. Another advantage of our methods is high computational
efficiency which comes from the usage of feedback technique. In this paper, we
also demonstrate that ILQR is essentially a quasi-Newton method with linear

fairly basically characterized by non-commutative algebras replacing
commutative. These classically appearing, in fact, in dealing with systems of
possibilities (say, all possible planetary motions under gravity of which one
is the actual one). In particular, contrary to too common usage, the quantum
non-commutativity should make it impossible to simply `transcend' the `system
of possibilities' aspect into a `yes-no' logic essential for an `actual world'.

method), the resulting discrete problem is well posed, and yields convergence
with optimal order on polygonal/polyhedral domains. On smooth two/three
dimensional domains, we combine both methods with a projection approach similar
to the one of [31]. We prove that, given a polygonal/polyhedral approximation
$\Omega_h$ of the domain $\Omega$, an optimal convergence rate can be achieved

Small-amplitude vibration is often assumed, leading to simplified physical

evaluation of discrete integral operators arising in wave scattering and other

hierarchical IFGF interpolation strategy, the proposed (hybrid MPI-OpenMP)
parallel implementation results in highly efficient data communication, and it
exhibits in practice excellent parallel scaling up to large numbers of cores --
without any hard limitations on the number of cores concurrently employed in an
efficient manner. Moreover, on any given number of cores, the proposed parallel
approach preserves the O(N log N) computing cost inherent in the sequential
version of the IFGF algorithm. Unlike other approaches, the IFGF method does
not utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and it is thus better suited than
other methods for efficient parallelization in distributed-memory computer
systems. A variety of numerical results presented in this paper illustrate the
character of the proposed parallel algorithm, including excellent weak and

Stone \cite{ES} implies that that every number in $[0, 1)$ is a jump for $r=2$.
Erd\H os \cite{E64} also showed that every number in $[0, r!/r^r)$ is a jump

Frankl and R\""odl \cite{FR84} gave a negative answer by showing a sequence of
non-jumps for every $r\ge 3$. After this, Erd\H os modified the question to be
whether $\frac{r!}{r^r}$ is a jump for $r\ge 3$? What's the smallest non-jump?
Frankl, Peng, R\""odl and Talbot \cite{FPRT} showed that ${5r!\over 2r^r}$ is a
non-jump for $r\ge 3$. Baber and Talbot \cite{BT0} showed that every
$\alpha\in[0.2299, 0.2316)\cup [0.2871, \frac{8}{27})$ is a jump for $r=3$.
Pikhurko \cite{Pikhurko2} showed that the set of all possible Tur\'an densities

whether $\frac{r!}{r^r}$ is a jump for $r\ge 3$ remains open, and
$\frac{5r!}{2r^r}$ has remained the known smallest non-jump for $r\ge 3$. In

paper, the classical Kapteyn series solution of Kepler's equation originally

framework of the so-called nonlinear sequence transformations.
  The main scope of the paper is to provide numerical evidences supporting the
fact that the Kapteyn series solution of Kepler's equation could be a Stieltjes
series. To support such a conjecture, two types of Levin-type sequence
transformations, namely Levin $d$- and Weniger $\delta$-transformations, will
be employed to sum up several wildly divergent series derived by the Debye
representation of Bessel functions. As an interesting byproduct of this
analysis, an effective recursive algorithm to generate arbitrarily higher-order
Debye's polynomials will be developed.
  Such a ""Stieltjeness"" conjecture will also be numerically validated by
directly employing the Levin-type transformations to accelerate the complex
Kapteyn series solution of the Kepler equation. Both $d$- and $\delta$-
transformations display exponential convergence, whose rate will be numerically
estimated. A few conclusive words, together with some hints for future

of $f(z)\in\bar{\mathbb{Q}}(z)$ where $f$ has degree $d\geq 2$. The first
problem is the conjecture that $\hat{h}_f(a)$ is either $0$ or transcendental
for every $a\in \mathbb{P}^1(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$; this holds when $f$ is
linearly conjugate to $z^d$ or $\pm C_d(z)$ where $C_d(z)$ is the Chebyshev
polynomial of degree $d$ since $\hat{H}_f(a)$ is algebraic for every $a$. Other
than this, very little is known: for example, it is not known if there
\emph{exists} even \emph{one} rational number $a$ such that $\hat{h}_f(a)$ is
\emph{irrational} where $f(z)=z^2+\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}$. The second problem
asks for the characterization of all pairs $(f,a)$ such that $\hat{H}_f(a)$ is
algebraic. In this paper, we solve the second problem and obtain significant
progress to the first problem in the case of polynomial dynamics. These are
consequences of our main result concerning the possible algebraic numbers that
can be expressed as a multiplicative combination of values of B\""ottcher
coordinates. The proof of our main result uses a construction of a certain
auxiliary polynomial and the powerful Medvedev-Scanlon classification of
preperiodic subvarieties of split polynomial maps.",['math.NT'],2021-12-30,['Khoa D. Nguyen']
190,Geometry of a Set and its Random covers,"Let $E$ be a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We study the following
questions: For i.i.d. samples $X_1, \dots, X_N$ drawn uniformly from $E$, what
is the probability that $\cup_i \mathbf{B}(X_i, \delta)$, the union of
$\delta$-balls centered at $X_i$, covers $E$? And how does the probability
depend on sample size $N$ and the radius of balls $\delta$? We present
geometric conditions of $E$ under which we derive lower bounds to this
probability. These lower bounds tend to $1$ as a function of $\exp{(-\delta^n
N)}$.
  The basic tool that we use to derive the lower bounds is a good partition of
$E$, i.e., one whose partition elements have diameters that are uniformly
bounded from above and have volumes that are uniformly bounded from below. We
show that if $E^c$, the complement of $E$, has positive reach then we can
construct a good partition of $E$. This partition is motivated by the Whitney
decomposition of $E$. On the other hand, we identify a class of bounded open
subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that do not satisfy this positive reach condition but
do have good partitions.
  In 2D when $E^c\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ does not have positive reach, we show
that the mutliscale flat norm can be used to approximate $E$ with a set that
has a good partition under certain conditions. In this case, we provide a lower
bound on the probability that the union of the balls \emph{almost} covers $E$.","['math.PR', 'math.DG']",2021-12-30,"['Enrique Alvarado', 'Bala Krishnamoorthy', 'Kevin R. Vixie']"

projective varieties is a variety $X$ endowed with a $\mathbb{C}^*$-action
inducing $\psi$ as the natural birational map among two extremal geometric
quotients. In this paper we study geometric realizations of some classic

birational transformations of type $(2,1)$--, by considering
$\mathbb{C}^*$-actions on certain rational homogeneous spaces and their

192,$\mu$-norm of an operator,"Let $({\cal X},\mu)$ be a measure space. For any measurable set
$Y\subset{\cal X}$ let $1_Y : {\cal X}\to{\mathbb R}$ be the indicator of $Y$
and let $\pi_Y$ be the orthogonal projector $L^2({\cal X})\ni f\mapsto\pi_Y f =
1_Y f$. For any bounded operator $W$ on $L^2({\cal X},\mu)$ we define its
$\mu$-norm $\|W\|_\mu = \inf_\chi\sqrt{\sum \mu(Y_j) \|W\pi_Y\|^2}$, where the
infinum is taken over all measurable partitions $\chi = \{Y_1,\ldots,Y_J\}$ of
${\cal X}$. We present some properties of the $\mu$-norm and some computations.
Our main motivation is the problem of the construction of a quantum entropy.","['math.DS', 'math.FA']",2021-12-30,['Dmitry Treschev']

amplitude of forces modeled as point sources; control constraints are also
considered. This particular setting leads to solutions to the state equation
exhibiting reduced regularity properties. We operate within the theory of
Muckenhoupt weights, Muckenhoupt--weighted Sobolev spaces, and the
corresponding weighted norm inequalities and derive the existence of optimal

  Operators","We consider the non-normal periodic Jacobi operator and the discrete versions
of the well-known Borg's Theorem. In this article, we extend the stability
results obtained recently to non-normal cases. The existing stability results
connect the oscillations of the matrix entries and the spectral gap size. Our
result covers the present self-adjoint versions of Borg's theorem and its
recent quantitative versions. Here the oscillations of the matrix entries are
linked with the path-connectedness of the pseudospectrum. We discuss the finite
difference approximations of various linear differential equations as specific
applications.","['math.SP', 'math.FA']",2021-12-30,"['Krishna Kumar G.', 'V. B. Kiran Kumar']"
197,Banach Spaces of GLT Sequences and Function Spaces,"The Generalized Locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences of matrices have been
originated from the study of certain partial differential equations. To be more
precise, such matrix sequences arise when we numerically approximate some
partial differential equations by discretization. The study of the asymptotic
spectral behaviour of GLT sequence is very important in analysing the solution
of corresponding partial differential equations. The approximating classes of
sequences (a.c.s) and the spectral symbols are important notions in this
connection. Recently, G. Barbarino obtained some additional results regarding
the theoretical aspects of such notions. He obtained the completeness of the
space of matrix sequences with respect to pseudo metric a.c.s. Also, he
identified the space of GLT sequences with the space of measurable functions.
In this article, we follow the same research line and obtain various results
connecting the sub-algebras of matrix sequence spaces and sub-algebras of
function spaces. In some cases, these are identifications as Banach spaces and
some of them are Banach algebra identifications. In the process, we also prove
that the convergence notions in the sense of eigenvalue/singular value
clustering are equivalent to the convergence with respect to the metrics
introduced here. These convergence notions are related to the study of
preconditioners in the case of matrix/operator sequences. Finally, as an
application of our main results, we establish a Korovkin-type result in the
setting of GLT sequences.","['math.FA', 'math.SP']",2021-12-30,"['V. B. Kiran Kumar', 'Rahul Rajan', 'N. S. Sarath Kumar']"
198,"Special cosmological models derived from the semiclassical Einstein
  equation on flat FLRW space-times","This article presents numerical work on a special case of the cosmological
semiclassical Einstein equation (SCE). The SCE describes the interaction of
relativistic quantum matter by the expected value of the renormalized
stress-energy tensor of a quantum field with classical gravity. Here we
consider a free massless scalar field with general (not necessarily conformal)
coupling to curvature. In a cosmological scenario with flat spatial sections
for special choices of the initial conditions, we observe a separation of the
dynamics of the quantum degrees of freedom from the dynamics of the scale
factor, which extends a classical result by Starobinsky to general coupling.
For this new equation of fourth order for the dynamics of the scale factor, we
study numerical solutions. Typical solutions show a radiation-like Big Bang for
the early universe and de Sitter-like expansion for the late universe. We
discuss a specific solution to the cosmological horizon problem that can be
produced by tuning parameters in the given equation. Although the model
proposed here only contains massless matter, we give a preliminary comparison
of the obtained cosmology with the $\Lambda$CDM standard model of cosmology and
investigate parameter ranges in which the new models to a certain extent
assimilates standard cosmology.","['gr-qc', 'math-ph', 'math.MP']",2021-12-30,"['Hanno Gottschalk', 'Nicolai Rothe', 'Daniel Siemssen']"
199,Invariant metrics on finite groups,"We study invariant and bi-invariant metrics on groups focusing on finite
groups $G$. We show that non-equivalent (bi) invariant metrics on $G$ are in
1-1 correspondence with unitary symmetric (conjugate) partitions on $G$. To
every metric group $(G,d)$ we associate to it the symmetry group and the
weighted graph of distances. Using these objects we can classify all
equivalence classes of invariant and bi-invariant metrics for small groups. We
then study the number of non-equivalent invariant and bi-invariant metrics on
$G$. We give an expression for the number of such metrics in terms of Bell
numbers, with closed expressions for certain groups such as abelian, dihedral,
quasidihedral and dicyclic groups. We then characterize all the groups (finite
or not) in which every invariant metric is also bi-invariant. We give the
number of non-equivalent invariant and bi-invariant metrics for all the groups
of order up to 32.",['math.CO'],2021-12-30,"['Ricardo A. Podestá', 'Maximiliano G. Vides']"
